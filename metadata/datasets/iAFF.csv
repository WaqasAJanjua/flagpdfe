1,238,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,AFF,"—With the development of human robot interactiontechnologies, haptic interfaces are widely used for 3D applicationsto provide the sense of touch. These interfaces have been utilizedin medical simulation, virtual assembly and remote manipulationtasks. However, haptic interface design and control are stillcritical problems to reproduce the highly sensitive touch sense ofhumans. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a7-DOF (degree of freedom) haptic interface based on the modiﬁeddelta mechanism. Firstly, both kinematics and dynamics of the",i11

A haptic controller is proposedbased on the forward kinematics and the gravity compensationalgorithm. To evaluate the control performance of the hapticinterface, a prototype has been implemented. Three kinds ofexperiments: gravity compensation, static response and forcetracking are performed respectively. The experimental resultsshow that the mean error of the gravity compensation is lessthan",i11
