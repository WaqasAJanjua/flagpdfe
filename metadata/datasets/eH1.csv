It [research] is typically absent from pseu-doscience and ideology.” For Bunge, exploration, investigation, and inquiry aresynonyms for research.

e44,628,Design Methods
e44,963,"generating and selecting optimal design solutions.In retrospect, the methods that were suggested andthe community that devised them were referred to as“the design methods movement.” A decade or twolater, it became evident that the high hopes per-taining to design methods had not been met, and theywere rejected in many design disciplines, possiblyexcluding engineering. Design researchers came to be-lieve that before they could impact the way design iscarried out, they must ﬁrst understand in depth howdesigners actually think. At that point, the design pro-cess had stopped being mystiﬁed and, as Lindgaardand Wesselius observed, the then-new ﬁelds of cogni-tive psychology and cognitive science were looked atas facilitating paths into thinking in design. Anotheroften overlooked force that kindled the interest indesign thinking was the impact of the postmodernculture starting in the 1970s. Postmodernists werevery interested in processes of creation—in literature,theater, cinema, art, and design. In architecturaldesign, for example, this was reﬂected in unprece-dented attention to preliminary sketches. Whereassuch sketches used to be discarded after a designsolution was solidiﬁed, and were never published orexhibited, they were henceforth archived and pub-lished in professional magazines and books. Casesin point are the thumbnail sketches made by JamesStirling in the 1970s for three museums in Germany—of which only one was built—that were published inprestigious professional magazines. not include embodiment (see below), metaphor andanalogy acquire a sharper speciﬁcity. Lindgaard andWesselius treat metaphor at length; I would like todraw attention to the twin relationship of analogy,which is at least as prevalent, and most inﬂuential,in design processes in all design domains. I refer toinventive analogies used during design ideation andnot to explanatory analogies. Metaphor may well bemore feeling-based than analogy, which depends onabstraction more than metaphor. But analogy, too,may incorporate interpretations based on feelings.A metaphor is a comparison in which the user"

e44,1830,"from the source situation. In other words, a rela-tionship between concrete components in the sourcesituation is abstracted, so that when transferred tothe target situation it can lead to a similar relation-ship between completely new and different concretecomponents. This combined transfer and transfor-mation mechanism allows a wide use of domainsas sources, which is why we distinguish betweenwithin-domain and between-domains in analogicalreasoning. As stated, it is possible that because ofthe abstraction and de-abstraction mechanisms inanalogy—which are missing from metaphor—analog-ical reasoning may encompass less feeling than doesmetaphor, where the choice of source is often moti-vated by feeling. However, in the transformationalstep in which components of the target situation areestablished, wherein imagery partakes, feeling maywell play a role. with the rationale for that proposal. No designdecision can be validated without a justiﬁcation and,therefore, proposal and rationale must always bealigned. This is another way of looking at the issue ofgood ﬁt in design. The use of metaphor is an intuitivemanner of seeking a good ﬁt, and analogy solidiﬁesthe rationale because of the structural resemblance toa situation that is already known and trusted in thesource situation."
e44,2092,"Abstraction and transformation help avoid ﬁxation,which often occurs when shallow features are trans-ferred from source to target, as when an analogy is ofsurface quality rather than structural. In analogicalreasoning, a problem solver abstracts relations be-tween concrete components or features in the source,often in a gradual process. In the target situation,the direction of the process is reversed, from a highabstraction to relations among a new set of concretecomponents. A good ﬁt should be attained betweenthe chosen components and the rest of the targetsituation. “Good ﬁt” is a term used by ChristopherAlexander to describe the agreement that must existbetween every single response to a partial problemand the responses to the various other partial prob-lems. This assertion was a consequence of Alexander’sview that to be solved successfully, design problemsmust be decomposed into sub problems that shouldbe solved separately before an integrated overallsolution can be achieved. Therefore, the question ofgood ﬁt among the components is of utmost impor-tance. The iterative nature of design thinking—andthe recommendation of design thinking as a methodto engage in frequent prototyping—is in line withthe notion of achieving good ﬁt among componentsand features. Analogy and imagery go hand in handhere, and as I have stated elsewhere, “we can assumethat over a sufficient number of cycles, enough trans-formations may take place to facilitate a good ﬁt between the components of what is being created.” Sketching is helpful in this process, as I will discussbelow. Iterative cycles in designing ensure that, atevery step, what is being proposed is well matched"

e44,2428,"could range from the building of scale models—suchas prototypes and mockups—to embodying the expe-rience of the user; for example, what one perceives and feels while walking through a building that is modeled through drawings. The term “felt-path” wasused by Schön to refer to the perceptions and ex-periences—including feelings—of a user as he or she"
e44,2696,"mentally wanders through a building when presentedwith its plans, sections, and elevations. Nowadays,this also applies to dynamic digital three-dimensionalsimulations. The user could be anyone, including thedesigner him- or herself; the description sounds like aguided tour of the building. Schön uses the term “spa-tial action language,”—a term I prefer to the currentlypopular term embodiment. Felt-path is akin to “feltmeaning” and “felt sense” as used by Lindgaard andWesselius. It also relates to these authors’ discoursepertaining to mental simulation when thinking ortalking about activity, and the notion of shallow anddeep processing, “suggest[ing] that the level of simula-tion may relate to degrees of ambiguity or uncertaintyin a situation.” Mental simulation/overt exploratoryactivity hinges on the use of intuition, and is a basicbuilding block in the construction of mental modelsthat designers and design teams must constructon the ﬂy to envision the design outcome they areworking to achieve. that have forms and shapes, and tangible propertieslike materials, color, texture, and so on. Therefore,representations in these domains are mostly visual orspatial. In the early, conceptual phases of the designprocess, it is vital for the designer to create quickrepresentations that he or she can react to, and whichmatch the pace of thought. The speediest, most con-venient and cognitively least costly mode of represen-tation is the rapid manual sketch. For experiencedsketchers—who generate sketches without having toevoke rules of production—sketching has many bene-ﬁts that support design thinking. Designers producevarious kinds of sketches—the thinking sketch, whichthe designer scribbles for him or herself as a thinkingaid; the talking sketch, meant for communicationwith others; and the prescriptive sketch, meant as arecord of properties of the designed entity, such asits dimensions. Here I address only the thinkingsketch, which is most relevant to the issue of designthinking from a cognitive point of view."
e44,2956,"The activity of sketching could also be consid- One of the prescribed recommendations ofdesign thinking as a method is the frequent pro-duction of prototypes. In engineering and industrialdesign, this usually means creating a rough, three-di-mensional model—a mockup—with the intention offacilitating feedback and evaluation. However, thephase in which the designer has a sufficiently workedout solution idea that can be physically modeled isa rather late in preliminary design. To get there, thedesigner conducts a search during which intenseidea-generation takes place; many of these ideasconcern partial problems and not necessarily theentire entity that is being targeted. This is the phasein which sketching excels as a yet-unbeatable mode ofrepresentation. Sketching serves the same purpose asprototypes later in the process—feedback and evalu-ation. Unbeatable, because no other mode of repre-sentation—including various digital modes—equalsrapid manual sketching in speed, ﬂexibility, toleranceto inaccuracy, lack of scale and incompletion, andcapability for reversibility and transformation at anymoment. Because sketching is relatively free ofrules, very fast, and not always pre-meditated, theemerging sketches can surprise the designer and offeropportunities for new interpretations—and, indeed,for unexpected discoveries."
e44,2969,"ered as an overt exploratory activity, and it is also akind of embodiment in which forms and shapes areﬁrst represented (see below). All three modes of rep-resentation, as described by Kaufmann, overlap eachother—that is, most representations are compositeand consist of at least two modes of representationthat act in tandem. Shifting between representationalmodes facilitates ﬂexibility, thus enhancing the cre-ative potential of the design activity, by allowingalternating modes of reasoning such as ideation andevaluation, association and analysis, divergence andconvergence."
