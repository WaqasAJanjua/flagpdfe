Darwin’s theory of evolution suggests that such mechanisms evolvedthrough variation guided by natural selection. However, there has existed no theory that would explainquantitatively which mechanisms can so evolve in realistic population sizes within realistic timeperiods, and which are too complex. In this article, we suggest such a theory. We treat Darwinianevolution as a form of computational learning from examples in which the course of learning isinﬂuenced only by the aggregate ﬁtness of the hypotheses on the examples, and not otherwise byspeciﬁc examples. We formulate a notion of evolvability that distinguishes function classes that are",a44

We suggest that the mechanism that underliesbiological evolution overall is “evolvable target pursuit”, which consists of a series of evolutionarystages, each one inexorably pursuing an evolvable target in the technical sense suggested above, eachsuch target being rendered evolvable by the serendipitous combination of the environment and theoutcomes of previous evolutionary stages.",a44
