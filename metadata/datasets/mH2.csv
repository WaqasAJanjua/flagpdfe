m28,1518,"In the present study, both of BC-MFC and BC-sisal hybrid ﬁbrous structures were prepared usingin situ self-assembly approach in fermentation media. Tensile tests were performed to characterize thenanocomposites prepared using these hybrid structures with SPI resin. In addition, microbond testswere performed to investigate the BC/sisal hybrid ﬁbrous structure/SPI resin interfacial shear stress(IFSS) to get a deeper understanding of the effect of incorporating BC layer around the sisal ﬁbers.Higher ﬁber/resin IFSS can be expected to result in improved tensile properties of the nanocomposites.The present study also describes how MFC and sisal ﬁbers can be utilized as substrates toself-assemble high-performance BC nanoﬁbers onto their surfaces to form hybrid ﬁbrous structures viaa novel one-pot fermentation route. The two hybrids can be utilized to fabricate green nanocompositesusing plant protein/starch based or other biodegradable resins, with better mechanical properties. Once fully developed, these green composites could be suitable for many applications where conventional, petroleum-based composites are currently used, including high-end racket frames,ski poles, circuit boards, automobile interiors, etc."

m28,4276,3.1. Mechanisms of In Situ Formation of BC-MFC and BC-Sisal Hybrid Fibrous Structures
m28,5796,"Since the effect of BC on the MFC-SPI resin IFSS was impossible to characterize directly, separateexperiments were carried out using sisal ﬁbers. Microbond tests have proven to be useful in obtainingIFSS values for such ﬁber/resin combination [31,35]. In the present case the microbeads shrink andtheir diameters decrease as the water evaporates during drying and curing. However, in the lengthwisedirection the resin grips the ﬁber preventing any shrinkage in that direction [31,35]. Figure 4 showsthe comparison of sisal ﬁber/SPI resin and BC-sisal hybrid ﬁber/SPI resin IFSS values. For sisal/SPIand BC-sisal/SPI, the IFSS values were 3.0 MPa and 3.6 MPa, respectively, a 20% increase afterself-assembling BC on sisal ﬁbers. The ANOVA test showed the p value of 0.02 at the signiﬁcance levelof 0.05 for comparison of the IFSS values for sisal/SPI and BC-sisal/SPI, indicating that the result issigniﬁcant. The reasons for the increased IFSS value can be summed up as follows: (1) increase inthe surface roughness of the sisal ﬁbers due to the presence of nanoscale BC; and (2) the potential fora large amount of hydrogen bonding between functional groups in the SPI resin and the hydroxylgroups present on the BC-sisal hybrid ﬁber surface [13,19–21]. However, since BC is very ﬂexiblebecause of its small diameter of 55 nm, there is a distinct possibility of some of it getting entrapped or incorporated in the resin and providing mechanical bonding or anchoring effect. The increased IFSS clearly indicate the beneﬁts of using self-assembled BC to modify the ﬁber surfaces [31,36]."

m29,1534,"According to Bourmaud et al. [28], the seeding density of linen ﬂax can inﬂuence the averagestem diameter. As for example, a seeding rate of 1110 plants/m produced a stem diameter of1.87 0.34 mm and a seeding rate of 2190 plants/m produced a stem diameter of 0.91 0.2 mm.They determined that sowing density had a low impact on the ﬁber’s mechanical properties untila critical value, which could be a result of ﬁber structure, chemical composition and/or a decreasein nutrients at higher seeding rates. A seeding rate of 1800 seeds/m was recommended as optimalbased on ﬁber yield, mechanical performance and plant stability."
m29,1627,"While Bourmaud et al. [28] investigated the plant densities ranging from 1110 plants/m to2190 plants/m , the plant densities for linseed ﬂax (grown for seed) are signiﬁcantly smaller. The FlaxCouncil of Canada [31] recommends that for unirrigated ﬁelds, plant densities should be no less than300 plants/m for optimum seed yield, and that densities greater than 400 plants/m can increase thechance of lodging and may not show increase in yield."

The PMMA doping was performed directly during the polymerization process (Ox170 molarconcentration 4.3 10 ) and 15 mm outer diameter preform was obtained. No visible polymerizationdefects were observed in the preform. The ﬁber (1.6 mm diameter, presented in Figure 2) wasfabricated using computer controlled optical ﬁber tower. The process parameters were as follows:furnace temperatures T = 160–185 C, preform feeding 0.3 cm/min, drawing speed 32–62 cm/min.Chosen ﬁber diameter assures high ﬂuorescence signal at low excitation laser power density whichhas to be limited since glass transition temperature of PMMA is c.a. 105 C."

Based on References [7,40], an irreversible model of the Maisotsenko reciprocating Brayton cycle (MRBC) will be established using the FTT theory with considerations of HTL, piston friction loss (PFL), and IILs in this paper. A calculation flowchart of the P and η of the cycle will be provided, and the effects of the pressure ratio, the maximum temperature of the cycle, the outlet temperature of humid air at the air saturator (AS), the outlet temperature of exhaust gas at AS, and the MFR of the injection of water to the performance of cycle will be analyzed by detailed numerical examples. 2. Cycle Model and Performance Analyses of Irreversible Maisotsenko Reciprocating Brayton Cycle The configuration of irreversible MRBC is shown in Figure 1 [7]. The operational scheme of AS is shown in Figure 2 [5]. Firstly, fresh air is compressed adiabatically, when the air, after being compressed, is separated into three strands and enters the bottom section of AS for heating and humidifying. All of the air streams are chilled down to the dew point temperature of the inlet air of AS by evaporation of water indirectly. One part of the airstreams is heated up and humidified to the saturation point sequentially in the bottom section of AS. The others blend and arrive at the above section of AS directly. Cooled dry air is heated up and humidified by utilizing the available waste heat from the expander exhaust gas afterwards in the top section of AS. In succession, humid air strands are mixed together and heated up before entering the cylinder in the above section of AS."
