m13,3264,"The spatial distribution of azimuthal dispersion may be visualized through the spatial mapof ∆Φ / ∆Φ 0 in selected illuminated spots of fresh and unfresh samples. Two typical color maps oforientation ﬂuctuation amplitude ∆Φ / ∆Φ 0 in fresh and unfresh samples, in an area of 300 125 µ m 2 , are depicted in Figure 3a, to the left and to the right, respectivley. The probability density functions (PDF) of orientation ﬂuctuations ∆Φ / ∆Φ 0 for the two samples are plotted in Figure 2b. The PDF of ∆Φ / ∆Φ 0 for the fresh sample shows a skewed line shape with a fat tail, which we found could beﬁtted by a Levy stable distribution [28–33], as shown in Figure 3b by the solid red curve. Recently,the Levy stable distribution has found increasing interest in several applications in diverse ﬁeldsfor describing complex phenomena [28–33]. This kind of probability distribution does not have ananalytical expression, but is represented by a characteristic function deﬁned by four parameters:stability index , skewness parameter , scale parameter (width of the distribution) and locationparameter . These parameters vary in the ranges of 0 < 2, 1 1, > 0 and real.For Gaussian distribution, the stability parameter becomes 2 Condens. Matter 2017 , 2 , 28  5 of 10 Figure 3.

A particular focus of this testing was to determine the linearity of thecalibration for the more volatile compounds being targeted by the new set-up (i.e., C -C ) over arange of mixing ratios from 0.4 to 4 ppbv. The results of these tests showed that this method was notsuitable for the analysis of species with 4 or less carbon atoms but gave a linear response for isoprene,the speciﬁc target compound of interest, at expected atmospheric mixing ratios (shown in Table 1)."

The HA titer, where HAU is expressed as the power of 2, is the reciprocal of the dilution that produces 1 HAU, where 1 HAU in the haemagglutinin titrationis the minimum amount of virus that will cause complete agglutination of the red blood cells.We also used HA proteins for the comparison in the binding assay, namely, 500 ng/mL derived fromA/California/07/2009 (H1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5).

m21,486,"In the last decades, both entropy and entropy generation have been largely applied in engineeringprocedures aiming to improve the performances of manufactured devices [1,2] as well as and formodelling the behaviour of natural phenomena. When the entropy generation (i.e., the irreversibility)is minimized in properly constrained components and systems, their exergy destruction becomesminimal [3,4]. Engineering approaches based on this concept allow designing and operating devicesand systems as efﬁciently as possible. Minimum entropy generation analysis has been appliedto thermal insulation problems involving minimum heat transfer at ﬁxed temperature differenceand thermal enhancement involving minimum temperature difference to exchange a ﬁxed heatﬂux [2]. In the literature, there are numerous applications of entropy generation analysis to storagesystems [5–7], ﬂuid ﬂow within technical devices [8–10], engines [11,12], heat exchangers [13,14] anddesalination plants [15]."
m21,2001,"The wind spreads towards the East with an intensity of 2 m/s. The terrain is 18 slope, directedtowards a direction between NE and N, so that an angle between wind and slope of 60 is obtained.As an effect, the main ﬁre propagation will occur between E and N. Fire propagation analysis lasts250 s, which is the time spent to reach the end of the domain."

m21,8728,"Entropy 2017 , 19 , 433 11 of 16 temperature variation in each time-step. The maximum values reached are considerably lower than those related to TERM 1 and TERM2. The integrals of the curve represented in Figure 6 are evaluated and results are reported in Figure 8 for all the considered values. Bars represent the total entropy generated during the entire process (until the first temperature peak). Figure 8. Entropy generated: three contributions. The values of TERM 1 significantly differ in the various sectors of the front. In particular, the largest values occur in the second flanks of the fire front, because of the higher temperature gradients.  The contributions due to mass transfer (TERM 2) are larger at the head of the fire front. This is particularly relevant for the point at the tip of the front (the point characterized by a larger y coordinate). Values are negative at the end of the lower front, due to two reasons: (1) in these cells the fire front propagates in a direction that is opposite with respect to the direction where the equivalent velocity spreads and (2) the entropy flux exchanged by the lateral surfaces is lower than zero. TERM 3 is quite similar in the various cells. Such values mainly depends on the temperature variation inside the control volume during the considered time. This varies between the environmental temperature and the first peak temperature. Consequentially the cells characterized by higher entropy generation are the ones in the central part of the fire front, where temperature rapidly increases when reached by the fire front. It is evident that TERM 3 is negligible compared to the contribution due to mass flow rate and heat exchanged. TERM 2 in the central part of the fire front includes some values of the same magnitude as the ones of the TERM 1 and more than ten times the TERM 3. If all the control volumes are considered, the mean contribution due to mass flow rate and the one due to the losses are quite similar (about 250 J/K). 4.3. Propagation Prediction Comparison Using the methodology described in Section 2, the evolution predictions for the STATE 2 are obtained for all the discussed approaches. Results are shown in Figure 9. The capability of the compact models in predicting the fire evolution can be evaluated through comparison of the corresponding fronts (plain line for the vector composition and dashed line for the entropy generation) with the results of the full physical model (bold line).

m28,2446,"MFC, as water based slurry (KY-100G) was received from Daicel Chemical Industries, Kita-Ku,Osaka, Japan. Homogeneous MFC containing culture medium was prepared by adding MFC (5% byweight of the culture media) into the mannitol culture medium (described above) to produce BC-MFChybrid ﬁbrous structure. The seed liquid (6 mL) was then inoculated into a 100-mL MFC-containingculture medium (600-mL conical ﬂask) after two days in seed culture (as described above). Conditionsof initial pH of 5.0 and 30 C were applied for BC cultivation in a static incubator for 10 days.The BC-MFC ﬁbrous hybrid structure produced on the surface of the MFC-containing mannitol culture medium was harvested after the 10-day incubation period. The BC-MFC hybrid ﬁbrous structure was then rinsed successively with water and 1% ( / ) aqueous NaOH at 90 C for 15 min and then furtherrinsed with deionized water to remove all remaining microbial contaminants. During the multi-steprinsing process, the BC-MFC ﬁbrous hybrid structure was treated with extreme care so as to avoid anyseparation of the MFC from the BC pellicle."
