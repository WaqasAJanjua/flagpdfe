e11,15,30,1,50,539,40,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"The voting behavior disclosed by shareholders in corporatemeetings is a key concern for researchers into the corporategovernance ﬁeld. Actually, many investigations have been car-ried out regarding the motivations of the vote direction (Choi,Fisch, & Kahan, 2008), as well as its effects (Becker, Bergstresser,& Subramanian, 2013; Fischer, Gramlich, Miller, & White, 2009),including its connection with shareholder wealth (DeAngelo &DeAngelo, 1989; Dodd & Warner, 1983; Mulherin & Poulsen, 1998)and corporate reputation (Bernile & Jarrell, 2009; Ertimur, Ferri, &Maber, 2012; Ferri & Maber, 2013)."

As a consequence, this methodologyhas been successfully applied to the analysis of different scenarios,with the aim of discovering the most relevant features for the expla-nation of a certain phenomenon (Huang, Cai, & Xu, 2007; Rozsypal& Kubat, 2003; Yang & Honavar, 1998)."
e11,20,37,1,50,570,309,196,251,GulliverRM,7,"The recent developments into the quantitative ﬁnance ﬁeld haveresulted in the appearance of complex mathematical models for theexplanation of different ﬁnancial phenomena, which are frequentlycharacterized by a lack of analytic representation. In this sense, sev-eral metaheuristic algorithms have demonstrated to be a suitablemethodology for addressing these ﬁnancial problems. In particular,genetic algorithms have been successfully applied to the analy-sis of different ﬁnancial scenarios with promising results. Thus,genetic algorithms have been recently used in value-at-risk com-puting (Sharma, Thulasiram, & Thulasiraman, 2015), bankruptcyresearch (Davalos, Leng, Feroz, & Cao, 2014; Shin & Lee, 2002;Wu, Tzeng, Goo, & Fang, 2007), optimal insurance risk alloca-tion (Ha, 2013), exchange rates prediction (Vasilakis, Theoﬁlatos,Georgopoulos, Karathanasopoulos, & Likothanassis, 2013), ﬁnan-cial failures forecasting (Chen, 2014), ﬁnancial fraud detection(Hoogs, Kiehl, Lacomb, & Senturk, 2007), portfolio optimization(Chang, Yang, & Chang, 2009; Oh, Kim, & Min, 2005) and stock mar-kets prediction (Ghoshal, Mukherjee, & Dhar, 2011; Karimi, Dastgir,& Shariati, 2014; Leigh, Purvis, & Ragusa, 2002)."

e11,26,44,2,910,1064,51,206,251,GulliverRM,7,"The voting behavior disclosed by shareholders in corporatemeeting has attracted increased attention from academics andpractitioners in recent times. Thus, a direct relation betweenshareholder wealth and proxy contests has been demonstrated(DeAngelo & DeAngelo, 1989; Dodd & Warner, 1983; Mulherin &Poulsen, 1998), with palpable consequences observable through-out ﬁnancial markets (Becker et al., 2013; Fischer et al., 2009). Inaddition, although there is a lack of consensus regarding the crite-ria that proxy advisors take into account in order to disclose theirvoting advise (Choi et al., 2008), they tend to acclaim a non-pro votewhen a company with low results discloses high executive compen-sation (Ertimur, Ferri, & Oesch, 2013), with a demonstrated directrelation between the application of the Say on Pay policy and cor-porate performance (Cu ˜nat, Gine, & Guadalupe, 2013), and someempirical ﬁndings on how corporate governance is linked to votedirection (Cai, Garner, & Walkling, 2009). Moreover, the damagesderived from reputational risk have been explored through votingbehavior, with voting pattern suggested as an adequate indicatorfor reputational harm (Bernile & Jarrell, 2009; Ertimur et al., 2012;Ferri & Maber, 2013)."
e11,27,45,2,910,1273,51,154,251,GulliverRM,7,"Despite being a general concern, lately the focus has turnedtoward the banking industry and the investigation of the votingpattern in this speciﬁc sector has been addressed, with specialattention to the effects of the Say on Pay policy (Yahr, 2013). Thatis a consequence of the relevant role in the germen of the ﬁnancialcrisis attributed to ﬁnancial institutions, and also frequent reputa-tional scandals affecting the banking industry contribute to explainthis raising degree of interest (Fiordelisi, Soana, & Schwizer, 2013).Indeed, it has been pointed out that the banking activity is par-ticularly sensitive to reputational issues (Allen & Santomero, 1997;Allen & Santomero, 2001; Bhattacharya & Thakor, 1993). As a matterof fact, corporate reputation has been referred as a strong com-petitive advantage for ﬁnancial institutions (Xifra & Ordeix, 2009)and reputational risk has been identiﬁed as a severe threat for thebanking business (Limentani & Tresoldi, 1998)."
e11,28,46,2,910,1430,51,123,251,GulliverRM,7,"Actually, the banking industry has been traditionally considereda suitable scope for research purposes, due to the special charac-teristics of the banking products, as well as the role that banks playas ﬁnancial intermediaries in an asymmetric information scenario(Allen & Santomero, 1997, 2001; Bhattacharya & Thakor, 1993). Infact, the United States banking industry is a particularly motivatingfocus for investigation, considering that the deregulation processthat has been affecting this sector in recent times makes it anadequate choice for addressing the corporate consequences of envi-ronmental changes (Berger, Kashyap, Scalise, Gertler, & Friedman,1995; Calomiris, 2000; Lounsbury, Hirsch, & Klinkerman, 1998;Marquis & Lounsbury, 2007)."

e11,30,48,2,910,1592,51,70,251,GulliverRM,7,"For the purpose of this research, we use the software WEKA,which is the short form for Waikato Environment for KnowledgeAnalysis, a famous solution deployed with Java technology bythe University of Waikato and distributed as free software underthe GNU General Public License, with remarkable applications formachine learning. The WEKA software includes a speciﬁc algorithmfor genetic search, which is the simple genetic algorithm described"
e11,31,49,2,910,975,320,112,251,GulliverRM,7,"in Goldberg (1989). This method estimates chromosomes consid-ering certain parameters previously stablished, including learningrate and momentum. For each chromosome, a merit indicator isprovided, as a measure of the classiﬁcation error rate. In addition,a scaled ﬁtness measure for each chromosome is also supplied(Larose, 2006). As a next step, the algorithm crosses over takingpairs of the best estimated chromosomes, and it also considers thepresence of mutations affecting descendants (Ahmed & Zeeshan,2014). Consequently, this technique results useful when it comesto build a subset of key attributes from a large dataset (Larose,2014)."
e11,32,50,2,910,1090,320,164,251,GulliverRM,7,"The data used in this study comprise votes emitted by thelargest large cap funds and by socially responsible investing fundsregarding managerial proposals about directors’ election and exec-utive compensation presented in corporate meetings organizedby companies in the United States banking sector from 2003 to2013. These voting data are collected from ofﬁcial SEC N-PX ﬁllingsby the non-proﬁt and non-partisan organization ProxyDemocracy,which has been recently referred as a suitable data provider forresearch purposes (Burns & Minnick, 2013). The ﬁnal dataset isformed by 95,234 votes corresponding to 309 United States banks.In addition, we pick different accounting and ﬁnancial indicatorsconcerning the companies in our research from the Bankscopedatabase, with the aim of discovering how these indicators affectthe vote direction disclosed in corporate meetings. As a result,this is the list of the variables considered in this investigation(Table 1)."

e11,38,56,2,910,1341,320,60,251,GulliverRM,7,"In order to apply the genetic search algorithm available in WEKAto our set of data, we begin by selecting the full training test modewith the following parameters: population size, 20; number of gen-erations, 20; probability of crossover, 0.6; probability of mutation,0.033. The results of this ﬁrst experiment are reported in the fol-lowing table (Table 3)."
e11,39,57,2,910,1404,320,81,251,GulliverRM,7,"This table shows the attributes subset in the third column. Eachindividual in the population represents one possible solution (oneattributes subset). Those with a highest ﬁtness (0.12746) corre-spond to a better solution (attributes: 1, 3, 13). Thus, the algorithmends selecting the attributes “Year (1)”, “Total number of funds (3)”and “Market capitalization (13)”. To test the stability of the results,we carry out different experiments changing the initial parameters(Table 4)."
e11,40,58,2,910,1487,320,39,251,GulliverRM,7,"As we can see, the results are consistent throughout all theexperiments, and the selected subset of attributes is always thesame. Finally, using the initial parameters, we accomplish a ﬁnalexperiment using a 10-fold cross validation mode (Table 5)."
e11,41,59,2,910,1529,320,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"The results reinforce the previous conclusions and they showthat the three main attributes still are “Year (1)”, “Total numberof funds (3)” and “Market capitalization (13)”, since they appearin 100% of the cases. However, a fourth attribute shyly arises, and“Tobin’s q (11)” is included in 20% of the folds."
e11,42,60,2,910,1582,320,81,251,GulliverRM,7,"Ultimately, all the consummated experiments point out the pre-dominance of three attributes in explaining the direction of theaggregated voting behavior observed in corporate meetings. Thus,the market capitalization appears as one of these main explana-tory factors, indicating that the market value of the ﬁrm inﬂuencesthe global vote direction. In addition, the total number of fundsvoting is also relevant, showing that the degree of activism dis-closed by institutional investors is a key determinant of the whole"

e11,58,76,3,1771,1871,220,220,334,GulliverRM,6,"This is a nominal variable with eleven values, one for each of the years contained in the sample.This is a dichotomous variable that can hold the class “sustain” or “not sustain”. For each bank and year in oursample, we count the pro votes and the non-pro votes regarding the corporate performance during that year.The non-pro votes include both abstains and against votes, since this is a common practice in the governanceindustry (Gregory-Smith & Main, 2013). If the pro votes overcome the non-pro votes, we give the class“sustain” for that bank and year. In other case, we assign the class “not sustain”.We calculate the total number of funds disclosing at least one vote for each bank and year.This variable shows the natural log of the total volume of assets for each bank and year.We calculate the number of years lapsed since the date of the ﬁrst corporate meeting of a given bank collectedin ProxyDemocracy.For each bank and year, we compute this ratio by relating operating proﬁt to total assets.For each bank and year, we calculate the inter-annual growth of the operating income.For each bank and year, we compute this ratio by relating the book value of liabilities to the book value ofequity.For each bank and year, we relate the amount of dividends paid to the market capitalization.For each bank and year, we compute this ratio by relating the operating proﬁt to the operating income.For each bank and year, we relate the market value of assets to the book value of assets. The market value ofassets is computed as the book value of assets plus the difference between the market value of equity and thebook value of equity. This calculation of the Tobin’s q ratio, and a variant that considers deferred taxes, isfrequently used in academic research (Bebchuk & Cohen, 2002; Gompers, Ishii, & Metrick, 2003; Jiao, 2010;Kaplan & Zingales, 1997) as an alternative to a more formal calculation (Lindenberg & Ross, 1981), which isdifﬁcult to use in practice. There is empirical evidence supporting the similarity between the formal and thelight deﬁnition of the Tobin’s q (Chung & Pruitt, 1994)For each bank and year, we relate the market capitalization to the net proﬁt."

Moreover, the yearappears as another signiﬁcant feature, indicating that the momentat which the votes refer is relevant in explaining their direction. Inorder to understand this last inﬂuential relation, it must be takeninto account that the time horizon considered in our sample cov-ers some critical moments for the United States banking sector,including bankruptcies, severe reputational failures, and mergersand acquisitions. Thus, our results suggest that these critical eventsmay have inﬂuenced the aggregated vote direction."
e11,107,154,4,2632,2812,51,7,60,GulliverBL,7,5. Conclusions
e11,108,155,4,2632,2835,51,70,251,GulliverRM,7,"Using a sample of 309 companies from the United States bank-ing industry, and collecting votes issued by the largest large capfunds and by socially responsible investing funds about manage-rial proposals presented in their corporate meetings during the11-year period from 2003 to 2013, we investigate the determinantsof the vote direction among an extensive set of ﬁnancial variablesby means of a genetic algorithm."
e11,109,156,4,2632,2908,51,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"Our ﬁndings suggest that there are three main attributes thatcontribute to explain the global voting support or rejection. First,the market capitalization of the ﬁrm appears as a key explanatoryfactor, indicating that the corporate market value is an inﬂu-ential feature. Second, the number of funds voting also arises,suggesting that the shareholder activism is a key feature as well.Finally, the moment at which the votes refer is also impor-tant, suggesting that the critical events affecting the bankingindustry in recent times may have affected the aggregated votedirection."
e11,110,157,4,2632,3012,51,39,251,GulliverRM,7,"Considering that voting behavior has been previously con-nected to reputational harm, our ﬁndings provide some interestinginsights about key aspects that should be considered in order tobuild an effective reputational risk management strategy."

RELATED WORK Anomaly detection, or outlier detection, is an activity for finding the patterns in dataset which do not conform to the expected pattern or deviates from the expected behavior greatly. Anomaly detection is of great significance in many applications and there are many different methods available for outlier detection so far.

RELATED WORK Anomaly detection, or outlier detection, is an activity for finding the patterns in dataset which do not conform to the expected pattern or deviates from the expected behavior greatly. Anomaly detection is of great significance in many applications and there are many different methods available for outlier detection so far.

As a result, some successful methods up to now have been proposed from the new perspective or adapted based on the traditional techniques and have been applied into some application scenes for anomaly detection of stream data.

e13,13,20,1,50,327,206,102,355,AdvP4DF60E,7,"A new method is proposed for determining the acid number (AN) of biodiesel using coulometric titrationwith potentiometric detection, basically employing a potentiostat/galvanostat and an electrochemicalcell containing a platinum electrode, a silver electrode, and a combination pH electrode. The methodinvolves a sequential application of a constant current between the platinum (cathode) and silver(anode) electrodes, followed by measuring the potential of the combination pH electrode, using anisopropanol/water mixture as solvent and LiCl as the supporting electrolyte. A preliminary evaluation ofthe new method, using acetic acid for doping a biodiesel sample, showed an average recovery of 100.1%.Compared to a volumetric titration-based method for determining the AN of several biodiesel samples(ranging from about 0.18 to 0.95 mg g"

Thus, the use of ethanol and biodiesel asalternative energy sources has increased, also having been inﬂu-enced by a variety of political, economic, and social factors [1–4].Biodiesel is basically composed of fatty acid alkyl esters, whichare obtained by the transesteriﬁcation of vegetable oils or animalfats, using a short-chain alcohol such as methanol or ethanol. Asthe physical properties of biodiesel are similar to those of diesel(derived from petroleum), the use of biodiesel as a fuel (pure or"

Moreover, biodiesel can be produced from fried oils orresidual animal fats and its combustion produces lower amountsof sulfur, particulate material, and greenhouse gases in compar-ison with diesel combustion [5–8]."

Due to its better precision and smaller sample size, the newmethod can contribute to the quality control of biodiesel, withbetter discrimination between conforming and non-conformingsamples around the AN limit values (established by regional andinternational regulations), while reducing the generation of waste"

e14,7,11,1,50,328,45,107,444,Times-Roman,8,"Memory based algorithms, often referred to as similarity based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular andsuccessful approaches to provide service recommendations. It provides automated and personalized suggestions to consumers toselect variety of products. Typically, the core of similarity based CF which greatly affect the performance of recommendationsystem is to ﬁnding similar users to a target user. Conventional similarity measures like Cosine, Pearson correlation coefﬁcient,Jaccard similarity suffer from accuracy problem under sparse environment. Hence in this paper, we propose a new similarityapproach based on Mean Measure of Divergence that takes rating habits of a user into account. The quality of recommendation ofproposed approach is analyzed on benchmark datasets: ML 100 K, ML-1 M and Each Movie for various sparsity levels. The resultsdepict that the proposed similarity measure outperforms existing measures in terms of prediction accuracy.© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."

e14,10,20,1,50,517,45,54,444,Times-Roman,9,A Recommendation system (RS) is a necessity and a popular technology to handle information explosion. It serves
e14,10,21,1,50,517,45,54,444,Times-Roman,9,"as an information ﬁltering tool and is commonly used to assist the target user to ﬁlter through a large pool of productsand present only those products that are of user’s interest. It gathers a large amount of data on the activities, inclinations,interest or taste of its client for a set of things i.e. movies, hardware item, garments and so forth and makes utilizationof this gathered data to give suggestions to different clients."
e14,11,22,1,50,574,45,77,444,Times-Roman,9,"In day to day life, we regularly depend on the opinion of like-minded individuals, individuals with comparabletaste and preference or other trusted sources about the nature and quality of assets to get the suggestions for aproduct or item. A RS automates this word-of-mouth phenomenon and is generally utilized by the online shoppingsites like Amazon to prescribe products of interest and by sites like Netﬂix to prescribe ﬁlms to the users by givingpersonalization suggestions. The signiﬁcance of RS increases inconceivably with the presence of long tail phenomenon(Anderson 2006). A physical retail store is characterized by shortage of resources. For instance, a fabric shop hasconstrained rack space and can show restricted assortment of items to a client. In the physical world it is impractical to"

We evaluate theproposed model with three well known real-life datasets (i) MovieLens 100 K (ML-100 K). The ML-100K dataset,consists of 100,000 ratings on 1682 items (movies) made by 943 users. In this dataset, the sparsity rating is 93.69%,which means that 4.25% of the movie has been rated by users. (ii) MovieLens 1 M (ML-1 M), consists of approximatelyone million ratings from 6,040 users who reviewed 3,952 movies. The sparsity rating of ML-1 M is about 95.75%.In both the MovieLens dataset, each movie is rated on a scale from 1 to 5 and (iii) the each movie dataset where weextracted a subset of 1,004 users who reviewed 1,091 movies with rating scale from 1 to 6."

It is observed that the different number ofneighbours (K) will give different predictions and accuracy. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed CJacMMDmethod, it is compared with four different similarity measures i.e. COS, PCC, ACOS and SRC."

CJacMMDoutperforms the other approaches consistently, regardless of neighbourhood size. It is observed that the range ofMAE and RMSE values in all the three dataset decreases as the value of K increases. That is because some similaritymeasures are sensitive to false neighbours, which results in the high similarity between two users, but in fact, theirpreference is not similar this often lead by the data sparsity."

e14,102,555,6,4013,4603,51,43,445,Times-Roman,9,CF has become an attractive subject for researchers because its capability to handle information overload efﬁciently.It provides personalized and automated suggestions to users based on their taste and those of similar interest. In order
e14,102,556,6,4013,4603,51,43,445,Times-Roman,9,"to overcome the problem of data sparsity, we proposed a new similarity measure based on Mean measure of divergencethat considers the behaviour habit effects of rated items to measure the similarity between users. The detailed analysis"

e14,105,560,7,4806,4869,42,32,444,Times-Roman,9,on three benchmark datasets indicates that the results of proposed approach are comparable with the traditionalapproach. The proposed technique provides better prediction accuracy. We plan to extend the proposed algorithm in areal-world recommender system.

e15,18,47,1,50,508,32,164,251,GulliverRM,7,"Pure silica modiﬁed with 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane hasfound several applications, such as the adsorption of divalentcations [1], reaction with an aromatic amine [2], functionalizationwith glutamic acid for the formation of a zwitterionic stationaryphase [3], and also functionalization with benzimidazole moleculesfor the concentration of metallic ions dispersed in ethanol solution[4]. Reaction of 3-chloropropylsiloxysilica with pyridine yields apyridinium substitution [5]. The anion exchange properties of a sil-ica gel surface modiﬁed with covalently bound pyridinium saltswere ﬁrst described by Tundo et al. for application as a catalyst [6].Later the exchange kinetics and selectivity of several anions usingsilica functionalized with the pyridinium ion were studied and thismaterial was used as a support in the adsorption of metallic ionsfrom aqueous and non-aqueous solutions [5,7–10]. The functional-ized silica was also used as a catalyst in the epoxidation of alkenes[11]."

e15,27,59,1,50,519,302,91,251,GulliverRM,7,"Stationary phases developed for the analysis of organic and inor-ganic anions usually have an organic polymer as the support for thepositively charged species. However polymeric phases for use inHPLC require signiﬁcant crosslinking for mechanical stability andthis reduces access to the ﬁxed charge by the species being sep-arated. Silica modiﬁed with covalently bonded organofunctionalgroups [15,16] such as aminopropyl [17] or phenylaminopropylgroups [18] present appropriate mechanical stability for use inHPLC."

This phase isreported to present both a reverse phase mechanism and anionexchange and has been used for amino acid and protein separations.This same research group has also synthetized similar reversed-anion exchange phases by grafting other imidazoles onto silica forthe separation of diverse test mixtures [20,21]."

Dado que no disponen de los mis-mos recursos ﬁnancieros que las grandes organizaciones (De Clercqy Belausteguigoitia Rius, 2007; Patel y Conklin, 2012), promover elCA puede reducir la importancia de la remuneración como princi-pal factor para motivar y retener a los empleados (Saridakis, Mu ˜nozTorres y Johnstone, 2013). La retención del personal no solo per-mite utilizar adecuadamente su capital humano, sino que tambiénreduce el coste de sustitución del personal saliente (Patel y Conklin,2012).

A ellose suma su mayor diﬁcultad de atracción, en comparación conlas empresas grandes y establecidas, debido a su menor legitima-ción y a la incertidumbre sobre el desarrollo futuro de la empresa(Breugst, Domurath, Patzelt y Klaukien, 2012). El desarrollo del CAes un medio para utilizar las competencias y los conocimientosque promueven el logro de los objetivos de las empresas intensi-vas en conocimiento. Investigación previa constata que el CA apoyala combinación y el intercambio de conocimiento (Camelo-Ordaz,García-Cruz, Sousa-Ginel y Valle-Cabrera, 2011), fomentando lainnovación (Xerri y Brunetto, 2013)."
e16,29,41,2,910,1090,40,300,251,GulliverRM,7,"Según Meyer y Allen (1991), el compromiso organizativo esun estado psicológico formado por 3 componentes: afectivo, decontinuidad y normativo. El CA se reﬁere al vínculo emocional, laidentiﬁcación e involucración del empleado con la organización,resultado de los valores e intereses compartidos (Meyer y Allen,1991). Mientras que el compromiso de continuidad se basa enel reconocimiento del coste asociado con abandonar la organiza-ción, el compromiso normativo reﬂeja el sentimiento de obligaciónde continuar con la relación laboral (Meyer y Allen, 1991). Sinembargo, se ha cuestionado la consideración del compromiso decontinuidad como una dimensión del compromiso organizativo, yla relación entre las dimensiones afectiva y normativa. El metaaná-lisis de Meyer, Stanley, Herscovitch y Topolnytsky (2002) encontróun coeﬁciente de correlación corregido de tan solo 0,05 entre elCA y el compromiso de continuidad. Algunos autores han sugeridoque la fuerte correlación hallada entre CA y compromiso normativo(0,63) diﬁculta separar ambas dimensiones desde el punto de vistaempírico (Lee y Chulguen, 2005). Según Solinger, van Olffen y Roe(2008, p. 74), el CA es una actitud hacia la organización, mientrasque el compromiso normativo y el de continuidad son actitudeshacia comportamientos especíﬁcos de permanecer o abandonarla organización. Para estos autores, el CA representa la dimen-sión más ﬁable y fuertemente validada del compromiso. El CA esel que ha mostrado de forma consistente relaciones más fuertescon resultados relevantes (menor absentismo y rotación, y mayordesempe ˜no) (Meyer et al., 2002). Diversos estudios han utilizadoel CA como único indicador del compromiso (Camelo-Ordaz et al.,2011; Saridakis et al., 2013; Xerri y Brunetto, 2013; Zargar et al.,2014). Por todas estas razones, este estudio se centra en el CA."
e16,30,42,2,910,1393,40,175,251,GulliverRM,7,"El CA está inﬂuido por las características personales y las expe-riencias de trabajo (en este estudio, las autoevaluaciones básicas[AEB] de los empleados y la importancia de la tarea). Las AEBse reﬁeren a las evaluaciones fundamentales que las personashacen de su propia valía, competencia y capacidades. Judge, Locke,Durham y Kluger (1998) consideran las AEB como un constructolatente unidimensional que causa que los empleados se vean así mismos como poseedores de alta autoestima, alta autoeﬁcaciageneralizada, bajo neuroticismo y con capacidad para controlarlos eventos. A diferencia de los estados de ánimo, las AEB sonrelativamente estables en el tiempo en torno a un punto de referen-cia; no obstante, pueden producirse ﬂuctuaciones momentáneassigniﬁcativas por encima o por debajo de ese punto (Judge yKammeyer-Mueller, 2011). Las AEB se han relacionado con la satis-facción y los resultados positivos (Chang, Ferris, Johnson, Roseny Tan, 2012); sin embargo, su vínculo con el CA permanece pocoexplorado."

Ello, a su vez, podráincrementar su CA."
e16,33,49,2,910,1038,309,217,251,GulliverRM,7,"Los objetivos de este estudio son 2. El primero es establecer unvínculo empírico entre las AEB, la importancia percibida de la tareay el CA. El segundo es analizar el papel mediador de la importanciade la tarea en la relación AEB-CA. Al examinar estas relaciones, elestudio contribuye a la literatura actual de varias formas. Primero,hasta donde alcanza nuestro conocimiento, no existe ningún estu-dio que considere el efecto de las AEB y la importancia de la tareasobre el CA de los empleados en el contexto de pymes intensivasen conocimiento. Estas empresas son especialmente importantespara la innovación y el progreso económico de un país (ComisiónEuropea, 2014). Dado que su capacidad innovadora y rendimientoestán estrechamente vinculados con el capital humano y social, pro-mover y sostener el CA de sus empleados es de vital relevancia.Segundo, con este estudio se cubre una carencia de investigaciónempírica sobre el papel de las AEB y la importancia de la tarea en elCA. Por último, aunque algunos estudios han investigado las carac-terísticas del puesto (de forma agregada) como variable mediadoraen la relación AEB-CA (p. ej., Kittinger, Walker, Cope y Wuensch,2009), solo somos conscientes de la existencia de un estudio quehaya analizado el papel mediador de la importancia percibida de latarea en dicha relación (Stumpp, Hülsheger, Muck y Maier, 2009)."

e16,37,59,2,910,1425,309,185,251,GulliverRM,7,"El marco aproximación/evitación (Chang et al., 2012) sugiereque las diferencias en la sensibilidad de las personas ante informa-ciones positivas (aproximación) y negativas (evitación) son las queimpulsan la relación entre AEB y resultados. Las personas con altasAEB son sensibles a los estímulos positivos e insensibles a los nega-tivos. Ferris et al. (2013) y Aryee et al. (2014) conﬁrmaron que laspersonas con altas AEB eran más propensas a adoptar una orien-tación motivacional hacia los estímulos positivos (aproximación)y menos propensas a los estímulos negativos (evitación). Las AEBpueden inﬂuir directamente en los resultados mediante un procesode generalización emocional. Las autoimágenes positivas se extien-den para inﬂuir en los resultados (Chang et al., 2012), entre ellos elCA. Según Stumpp et al. (2009), los sentimientos positivos acerca deuno mismo inﬂuyen en los sentimientos positivos acerca de la orga-nización. El reciente metaanálisis de Chang et al. (2012) corroboróque las AEB se correlacionaron con el CA y con el apoyo percibido,uno de los antecedentes más importantes del CA y la identiﬁcacióncon la organización (Kurtessis et al., 2015)."

e16,42,64,3,1771,1867,51,259,251,GulliverRM,7,"Raja, Johns y Ntalianis (2004) plantearon que las característicasde los empleados inﬂuyen en el tipo de contrato psicológico quetenderán a establecer con la organización, y en el CA subsiguiente.Los contratos relacionales —intercambios amplios a largo plazobasados en un acuerdo mutuo que implica intercambios socioe-mocionales (Rousseau, 1995)— generan sentimientos de apego ala organización y un mayor CA (Bal, Kooij y de Jong, 2013). SegúnRaja et al. (2004), las características de los empleados con alto neu-roticismo sugieren que no se comprometerán en relaciones queexijan un compromiso a largo plazo, demanden habilidades socia-les o conﬁar en otros. Las personas que atribuyen el éxito o fracasoa factores externos, más allá de su control, prestan escasa aten-ción a las relaciones futuras y tenderán a formar contratos que lesofrezcan resultados a corto plazo. Los empleados con alta autoes-tima tienden a mostrar deseos de crecimiento y logro, difíciles desatisfacer mediante una relación meramente económica y a cortoplazo. Los resultados del estudio de Raja et al. (2004) conﬁrmaronque los empleados con bajo neuroticismo, creencia en su capaci-dad para controlar los sucesos y alta autoestima tendieron a formarcontratos relacionales que contribuyeron a su CA. Varios metaaná-lisis (Meyer et al., 2002; Bowling, Eschleman, Wang, Kirkendall yAlarcon, 2010) ratiﬁcan la relación entre dimensiones particula-res de las AEB (capacidad para controlar los sucesos, autoestimageneral) y el CA. Teniendo en cuenta los argumentos anteriores y laevidencia empírica existente, se plantea:"

e16,45,68,3,1771,2181,51,112,251,GulliverRM,7,"Diversos estudios (Judge et al., 1998; Judge, Bono y Locke, 2000;Kittinger et al., 2009) han demostrado la existencia de una relaciónsigniﬁcativa entre AEB y puestos enriquecidos. El reciente metaa-nálisis de Chang et al. (2012) encontró una correlación signiﬁcativade 0,39 entre ambas variables. Los empleados con altas AEB tiendena ver su trabajo de forma más favorable, atribuyéndole cualidadesmás positivas (como mayor autonomía o importancia de la tarea)(Ferris et al., 2011). Judge et al. (1998) aﬁrmaron que las personascon AEB positivas tienden a buscar y a procesar la información delentorno laboral, prestando más atención a los aspectos positivos,para conﬁrmar su autoconcepto."
e16,46,69,3,1771,2296,51,123,251,GulliverRM,7,"Por su parte, Stumpp et al. (2009), basándose en la teoría deidentiﬁcación de la acción (Vallacher, Wegner y Frederick, 1987),argumentaron que la percepción de importancia de la tarea estáinﬂuida por las diferencias en el nivel de identiﬁcación de la tareaentre las personas con altas y bajas AEB. Según esta teoría, las accio-nes exitosas son identiﬁcadas a un mayor nivel que las accionesno exitosas. Puesto que los empleados con altas AEB suelen cen-trarse más en los aspectos positivos de alcanzar el éxito que en losinconvenientes del fracaso (Ferris et al., 2011), y creen en su pro-pia capacidad, podrían juzgar sus acciones de forma más exitosaque aquellos con bajas AEB. De este modo, podrían percibir mayorsigniﬁcación en sus tareas."
e16,47,70,3,1771,2421,51,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"Por otro lado, se ha sugerido que los empleados con autoconcep-tos positivos, al conﬁar en sus habilidades para manejar los desafíosdel puesto (Judge et al., 2000), se sienten más atraídos por puestosretadores y complejos, que ofrecen mayor potencial de recompen-sas intrínsecas y generan mayor signiﬁcación (Rode et al., 2012).Las personas con AEB positivas perciben las tareas desaﬁantes ycomplejas como oportunidades de las que aprender y beneﬁciarse,mientras que aquellas con AEB negativas las consideran algo inme-recido o una amenaza a evitar (Srivastava, Locke, Judge y Adams,2010). Los estudios de Judge et al. (2000) y Srivastava et al. (2010)"
e16,48,71,3,1771,1836,320,70,251,GulliverRM,7,"encontraron que la relación AEB-percepción de enriquecimientodel puesto estaba parcialmente mediada por la complejidad delpuesto (inferida por el título del puesto) y la búsqueda de tareascomplejas por parte del empleado, respectivamente. La comple-jidad del puesto se ha asociado con la importancia de la tarea(Humphrey et al., 2007). Considerando los argumentos expuestos,se propone:"

e16,51,75,3,1771,1993,320,259,251,GulliverRM,7,"Investigación previa ha corroborado que las características delpuesto se relacionan con el compromiso (Humphrey et al., 2007).Sin embargo, con pocas excepciones (p. ej., Stumpp et al., 2009),una gran parte de los estudios han combinado las característicasdel puesto en una única medida de enriquecimiento del puesto(Kittinger et al., 2009; Gillet y Vandenberghe, 2014; Wang, Ma yZhang, 2014; Zargar et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, poco se sabe acercade cómo dimensiones particulares del puesto pueden afectar al CA.El metaanálisis realizado por Humphrey et al. (2007) conﬁrmóque la importancia de la tarea es la característica del puestomás fuertemente relacionada con el compromiso y la motivacióninterna (0,44 y 0,45, respectivamente). El estudio de Stumpp et al.(2009) evidenció que esta fue la única dimensión del puesto que serelacionó signiﬁcativamente con el CA. La importancia de la tarea esconsiderada el predictor más consistente de la signiﬁcación expe-rimentada en el trabajo, mientras que la variedad y la identidadson algo más inestables (Morgeson y Campion, 2003). La signiﬁca-ción experimentada es uno de los 3 estados psicológicos a travésde los cuales las características del trabajo (variedad, importanciae identidad) afectan a los resultados actitudinales y conductua-les (Hackman y Oldham, 1980). Las personas cuyos puestos tienenun impacto sustancial en el bienestar físico o psicológico de otrosexperimentarán una mayor signiﬁcación en el trabajo (es decir, con-siderarán su trabajo más valioso y útil), lo cual incrementará sumotivación intrínseca y fortalecerá su CA."
e16,52,76,3,1771,2255,320,133,251,GulliverRM,7,"Para Grant (2007), la importancia de la tarea es también unacaracterística relacional del puesto. Al se ˜nalar a los empleados quesus acciones y esfuerzos pueden contribuir al bienestar de otrosincrementa la percepción de que sus puestos están relacionadosy conectados con otros, y activa la motivación pro-social delos empleados (Grant, 2007, 2008). Más allá de las recompen-sas intrínsecas asociadas al puesto, la importancia de la tareafomenta la motivación trascendente de contribuir al bienestar deotros y fortalece el vínculo con la organización (Melé, 2003). Laimportancia de la tarea se ha relacionado también con la mayoridentiﬁcación de los nuevos empleados con la organización (Slusset al., 2012) y con los estados afectivos positivos (Saavedra y Kwun,2000) que, a su vez, promueven el CA."

Aunque las percepciones de los empleados estáninﬂuidas por las características objetivas del puesto, las caracterís-ticas personales modelan la forma en la que entienden su entornoy reaccionan a él. En tercer lugar, se conﬁrma que cuando losempleados perciben que sus tareas son importantes aumenta suCA, sugiriendo que los beneﬁcios de realizar tareas signiﬁcativasson atribuidos a la organización. Un hallazgo particularmente inte-resante es el papel de mediación parcial de la importancia de latarea en la relación AEB-CA. Reaﬁrmando los resultados del estudiode Stumpp et al. (2009), las AEB afectan indirectamente al CA, alinﬂuenciar las cogniciones de los empleados y las valoraciones querealizan sobre la importancia de sus tareas. Con ello reforzamos elconocimiento acerca de los mediadores en la relación AEB-CA."

Pueden dise ˜nar los pues-tos de forma que incluyan características motivadoras, como laimportancia de la tarea. Considerando que la importancia que losempleados atribuyen a su trabajo está inﬂuida en parte por el lide-razgo transformador del supervisor inmediato (Wang et al., 2014),se recomienda también prestar atención a la implantación de pro-gramas formativos que promuevan este estilo de liderazgo. Loslíderes transformadores, al clariﬁcar la relevancia de las contribu-ciones de los empleados para los objetivos y la misión de la empresay hacerles ver el impacto que tiene su trabajo sobre otros (Grant,2008; Cleavenger y Munyon, 2013), incrementarán su percepciónde importancia de la tarea y, con ello, su CA."

Por ello, una incorrecta seleccióntendrá quizá consecuencias más negativas en estas empresas queen las grandes y establecidas. Los empleados con altas AEB no solomuestran mayor rendimiento, comportamientos de ciudadanía omotivación (Rode et al., 2012; Chiang et al., 2014), sino que tambiénperciben su trabajo de forma más exitosa y signiﬁcativa, y se sientenmás vinculados afectivamente con la empresa. Estudios recientesconstatan también la relación entre AEB y la adopción de un estilode liderazgo transformador (Hu, Wang, Liden y Sun, 2012).

Primero,su dise ˜no transversal impide extraer conclusiones sobre la causa-lidad o descartar la posibilidad de causalidad inversa. Se necesitanestudios longitudinales que apoyen la causalidad de estas rela-ciones. Segundo, todos los datos proceden de la misma fuente:los propios empleados. Aunque el sesgo del método común raravez es suﬁcientemente grave como hacer peligrar la validez de losresultados (Spector, 2006), para intentar reducirlo se siguieron lasrecomendaciones de Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee y Podsakoff (2003)relativas al dise ˜no del cuestionario. Futuros estudios podrían consi-derar las percepciones de los supervisores o compa ˜neros al evaluarel CA o las características del puesto. Tercero, el foco en empleadosde jóvenes pymes intensivas en conocimiento espa ˜nolas y las carac-terísticas de la muestra limitan la generalización de los resultados.Dado que solo una proporción relativamente peque ˜na de pymesopera en estos sectores, investigaciones futuras deberían conside-rar su aplicación entre empleados de otros sectores y contextos. Porúltimo, al centrarnos en los empleados de un número limitado deempresas, no podemos asegurar que la muestra sea representativade la población."

Ahora bien,la situación actual de alto desempleo podría fortalecer el compro-miso de continuidad debido a la percepción de falta de alternativasexternas. Sin embargo, dado que los empleados con AEB positi-vas son menos sensibles a los estímulos negativos (Chang et al.,2012), confían en sí mismos y en sus capacidades, y aprovechanmejor sus recursos y oportunidades (Judge y Kammeyer-Mueller,2011), podrían tener percepciones más optimistas sobre su valoren el mercado laboral y conﬁar más en su empleabilidad.

e18,16,46,1,50,575,42,133,251,AdvOT863180fb,7,The use of lubricating oils is very important in various sectors
e18,16,47,1,50,575,42,133,251,AdvOT863180fb,7,"of the modern society, since they are largely employed in thelubrication of engines of cars, buses and other vehicles, machinesand in the industrial context [1]. In order to prevent engine failure,the lubricating oil must be changed in a given interval of time thatdepends on the condition of the oil. A good way to evaluate thecondition of lubricating oils is the determination of the concentra-tion of metals, which helps one to identify the excessive wear ofthe engine [2]. Another aspect to be considered is related toenvironmental issues. Used lubricating oils are classi"

On the otherhand, the application of the same statistical test for Fe indicatedthat there was difference between the values obtained by the twomethods. However, analyzing the results for Fe in detail it waspossible to realize that these differences occurred due to thediscrepant values observed in the analysis of the samples thatcontained concentrations of Fe higher than 80"

e19,7,10,1,50,352,44,108,447,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,8,Task allocation is one of the keys to maximize organizational beneﬁts by handling as many tasks as possible. Many computationalmulti-agent systems use agent’s

e19,7,12,1,50,352,44,108,447,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,8,"for task allocation. When a task arrives at the queue to be delivered a task allocator willdetermine which takes the task by ﬁnding the best-capable agent. In real world situation, each agent should not only consider thenew task with their capability, but also tasks that they are currently handling before sending their capability to the task allocator.This research study proposes a CPU-scheduling based algorithm to allow agents to perform rational decision making when theythink that they can handle the new task while taking care of its current tasks. The result shows that applying algorithm provide asigniﬁcant improvement of their performance.c"

As they are partof an organization in systems, accomplishing goals is one of their duties as a member and it usually beneﬁts to theorganization as well as to the individuals. When agents are cooperative they can be considered as socially-interestedagents which seek to maximize social proﬁts for the organization. The"

e19,18,54,2,842,1142,49,43,447,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,"Fig. 1 shows a ﬂow chart of the target scenario in a heterogeneous MAS that follows DAI. In the scenario thehuman operator, the job allocator and also be treated as an agent, is trying to assign a task to one of the members in theorganization. The most intuitive way to do it is ﬁnding the best-capable agent for the task. The following proceduredescribes three steps for the task allocation:"
e19,19,55,2,842,1199,56,9,440,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,1. Acquisition: the allocator sends a message to the rosters to get a list of capability for the task. We assume that
e19,20,56,2,842,1211,68,9,376,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,the rosters are cooperative so that they are honest in sending their capability value to the requester.
e19,21,57,2,842,1222,56,43,440,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,"2. Selection: According to the list of capability for the task, the allocator selects one agent to delegate. Thereare numerous ways to determine the selection, but the agent which has the best capability for the task will beselected in this scenario.If more than one agent with the same capability become candidates, the allocatorrandomly selects one."
e19,22,58,2,842,1268,56,9,440,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,"3. Delegation: the allocator sends a command to the selected agent. It also sends the detail information of the task,"
e19,23,59,2,842,1279,68,9,118,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,"e.g., instructions, deadline, etc."
e19,24,60,2,842,1302,49,55,447,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,"Even though there are lots of debatable facts in the scenario, we ignore them and focus on the steps mentionedabove. For example, if the allocator once knows the rosters capability on a task, it does not need to ask again for thesame task in the future. Another debatable issue would be sending a query to only the capable rosters which have beenproved (or desired) for the task to reduce network tra"

e19,24,62,2,842,1302,49,55,447,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,c. We also assume that all agents are capable of interpretingmessages when communicating.
e19,25,63,2,842,1360,49,78,447,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,"When the scenario is applied to real world, the responding agents should be able to determine whether or not it cantake the new task at the moment before replying its capability. For instance, if an agent is working on a task, it maynot be able to take the new task to do. However, it may be possible that the agent holds the current task and proceedthe new task if the current task has enough deadline. This could improve performance of the organization, e.g, higherquality of results. Thus, this research study investigates how agents can arrange tasks with the given deadlines, asknown as"

e19,69,314,5,3220,3752,46,78,447,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,"Task allocation in DAI-enabled heterogeneous MAS is challenging because each agent has incomplete informationto rationally determine which agent takes which task. Considering only an organization view says that it is better toallocate tasks to the best-capable agent as much as possible in order to maximize their beneﬁt. This study proposeda CPU scheduling-based algorithm to allow agents to perform rational decision for the organization. Because thestructure of whether or not they take a task is similar with CPU scheduling that has multiple cores (i.e., agents), webelieve that more advanced scheduling theories and algorithms, e.g., Round Robin, can be applied to solve the taskallocation problem."
e19,70,315,5,3220,3832,46,43,447,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,9,"The future work of this research study will 1) elaborate characteristics of tasks (e.g., importance of tasks), 2) ﬁndingindependent variables that a"

In particular, applying boost mechanism of agents could deal withtasks that nearly pass its deadline. For instance, an agent could deliver task twice faster by consuming more energy."

When an artwork isscanned using a predesigned mobile application certain image reference portions get animated along with some music and sound.In this work, a reference area is found in the input video frame using SURF detector and BRISK descriptor and the virtual object isplaced in the particular position.

Highly developed techniques in Graphics and Virtual Reality allow for increasingly realistic ARvisuals. Elaborate tracking systems, input devices and computer vision techniques improve the registration of imagesand user interaction in AR setups. However, most commonly used AR systems still require sophisticated hardwaretracking solutions, or at least ﬁducial markers [9]. ARToolKit [4] is a software library for building marker based Aug-mented Reality (AR) applications. Squared black and white markers with an embedded code is used in ARToolKit."

e21,11,22,1,50,454,181,107,360,TrebuchetMS,8,"Recommender systems play an important role in our day-to-day life. A recom-mender system automatically suggests an item to a user that he/she might be interested in. Small-scale datasets are used to provide recommendations based on location, but in real time, the volumeof data is large. We have selected Foursquare dataset to study the need for big data in recom-mendation systems for location-based social network (LBSN). A few quality parameters like par-allel processing and multimodal interface have been selected to study the need for big data inrecommender systems. This paper provides a study and analysis of quality parameters of rec-ommendation systems for LBSN with big data.© 2016 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Indian Institute of ManagementBangalore."

An LBSN adds a locationto an existing social network, and also tells the people in theirsocial network that they can share their location-related in-formation. Based on the location-related information, a newabstract structure is derived and connects connected indi-viduals based on their location-related content, such as photos,texts and videos.

e21,22,37,2,893,1168,53,151,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"Location is one of the important components of usercontext and implies extensive knowledge about a user’s in-terests and behaviour, thereby providing us with opportuni-ties to better understand users in an abstract structure notonly according to user behaviour, but the mobility of the userand his/her activities in the physical world. In recent timeslocation-based services, such as tour guide and location-based social network, have accumulated a lot of location data.Today, the positioning function in mobile devices, such as GPS-phones, lets people know their locations easily. This loca-tion data provide various location-based services on the weband has shown itself to be attractive to the users.

This improves the efﬁciency of content delivery net-works using a novel caching mechanism based on geographiclocation. A real-time recommendation system, as suggestedin Sandholm and Dung (2011), has been built for online webcontent using a collaborative ﬁltering method to make morediverse and personalised recommendations within a geo-graphical area. Levandoski, Sarwat, Eldawy, and Mokbel (2012)have proposed a novel location-aware recommendation system(LARS) framework to exploit users’ ratings of locations usinga technique that uses the distance of querying users to in-ﬂuence recommendations."

Due to the dynamicnature of the recommender system, the data have to be dis-tributed. The recommender system has to work parallelly toprovide recommendation to the user and to support differ-ent interfaces. Big data excels in handling unstructured, rawand complex data with huge programming ﬂexibility. Thisstudy analyses the use of big data in recommendation systemsqualitatively. In future research, we will attempt to analysethe recommendation system in social networks quantitatively."

The  audit  committeeeffectiveness depends on the prosperity or financial distress of companies,such  as  financially  literate  audit  committee  members  increase  thecompany  performance  and  prevent  its  financial  distress  [6],  [7].  Thisevidence  of  competence  between  members  enhances  companyperformance and reduces the likelihood of  financial problems.

During thisperiod,  four  banks  became  insolvent  and  eleven  had  to  resort  to  CentralBank lending [10]. Moreover, in this paper, audit committee performanceis  studied  by  showing  the  audit  committee  characteristic  relation  withfinancially  and  non-distressed  banks.  For  the  purpose  of  this  paper,financially distressed banks consist of those under profitability problems.The financially non-distressed banks are the ones with a significant rate ofprofitability. It is expected that audit committee with good characteristicsis negatively related to the financial distress of the bank. The performanceof  Lebanese  bank  sector  has  previously  been  examined  in  term  ofgovernance practices [11]. The paper used the impact of outside directorson  bank  performance  without  taking  into  consideration  audit  committeeeffectiveness.  However,  this  paper  goes  beyond  comparing  the  bankprofitability  among  distressed  and  non-distressed  banks.  It  examines  therelationship  between  the  characteristics  of  audit  committee  and  thefinancial distress of these banks. In addition, it examines audit committeeeffectiveness taking into consideration their role, their objective and theirresponsibility  to  provide  bank  prosperity.  This  is  essential  to  focus  onevaluating committee effectiveness to avoid financial distress.The  establishment decision  of  audit committee  was  adopted  in  2008  andwas modified in 2010 in Lebanese banks.

According to agency theory, aconflict  exists  between  shareholders  and  managers.  Therefore,  the  topmanagement may take some decisions which are not for the best interestof shareholders [13]. In this context, there is an asymmetry of informationbetween these two poles. The separation of decision management helps tocontrol this asymmetry by limiting the power of the agent and preventingthe deviation of shareholders interest [14]. Hence, the agency costs factors[12].  Thisshouldeffectiveness is used to reduce such conflict  [15]. Many studies examinethe  relationships  between  effectiveness  of  audit  committee  and  entityperformance. Mixed  results  were  found between  these  two  variables  [6],[16]. Hence, [17] suggests that firms with effective audit committees haveless  earnings management. Prior studies have examined the role of auditcommittee  characteristics  in  firm  performance  [18].  Results  suggest  thatsize of audit committee and financial experts of audit committee membersare able to explain the behavioral practices of the voluntary disclosure ofintellectual  capital.  This  paper  studies  the  relationships  between  auditcommittee  characteristics  (size,  composition,  frequency  of  meetings  andfinancial literacy of members) and bank financial distress."
e22,68,156,3,1737,1826,65,608,229,Times-BoldItalic,7,2.1. Size of audit committee
e22,68,158,3,1737,1826,65,608,229,TimesNewRoman,7,"[19]  indicates  that  large  audit  committees  provide  more  monitoringresources of top management and quality of the financial reports. It mayenhance  the  internal  governance  practice  and  improve  the  resources  ofinternal  monitoring.  Prior  studies  found  mixed  results  in the  relationshipbetween  audit  committee  and  company  financial  performance.  Anotherresearch  [20],  finds  that  large  audit  committee  improves  financialreporting  quality,  as  its  effectiveness  increases  with  the  existence  ofexperienced  and  knowledgeable  members  [21].  This  is  evidence  that  theright-sized committees can use their experience to help the committee inmonitoring. On the other hand, it is found that a weak association betweenthe  size  of  audit  committee  and  company  performance  [22],  [23].Therefore, the large audit committee loses concentration and becomes lessparticipative  than  the  smaller  one.  However,  there  is  not  any  significantrelationship between size of audit committee and financial distress [6].  Incontrol perspective, result of prior study supports the monitoring functionof  the  audit  committee  characteristics.  [3]  found  that  smaller  boardsmonitor better than  larger  ones.  The  audit committee  with  small  numberof members tends to be more participative comparing to those of a largersize.  However,  larger  audit  committees  are  more  efficient  in  monitoring"

In  Lebanon,  basic  circular  no.  118issued  by  BDL  obliges  to  compose  at  least  three  members  in  auditcommittee of Lebanese bank. Thus, our first hypothesis is developed:H1:  There  is  a  significant negative  relationship  between  size  of  an  auditcommittee and financial distress."
e22,68,160,3,1737,1826,65,608,229,Times-BoldItalic,7,2.2. Composition of an audit committee
e22,68,162,3,1737,1826,65,608,229,TimesNewRoman,7,Audit  committee  composition  focuses  on  independence  aspect.  It  isdefined  by  the  ratio  of  non-executive  and  executive  directors.  The  audit
e22,68,163,3,1737,1826,65,608,229,TimesNewRoman,7,"committee  is  considered  independent  when  the  domination  of  non-executive  directors  is  considered.  However,  executive  members  canimpair  the  effectiveness  of  audit  committee  by  influencing  the  decision-"
e22,69,164,3,1737,1801,309,630,229,TimesNewRoman,7,making  process  of  the  board  [25].  High  presence  of  executive  directorslimits the amount of information held by board members. More than one
e22,69,165,3,1737,1801,309,630,229,TimesNewRoman,7,"method was found to reduce this information’s asymmetry. Thus, a large"
e22,69,166,3,1737,1801,309,630,229,TimesNewRoman,7,"proportion of independent directors enhances management monitoring [3],which evidences that more independent audit committee has a high levelof  audit  coverage  [26].  There  is  evidence  that  more  independent  auditcommittees are seeking to preserve the independence of the external auditprocess.  The  participation  of  non-executive  members  in  large  proportionimproves  the  audit  committee  independence.  This  enhancement  of  auditcommittee independence should facilitate decision and assure informationobjectivity [27]. For this reason, the audit committee should maintain themonitoring  role  delegated  by  the  board  with  aim  to  provide  betterreliability  of  information.  Consequently,  the  presence  of  independentboard committees increases the capacity of corporate boards to effectivelyadvise, monitor and discipline top management [28].Non-executive directors are considered to be an important mechanism inensuring  corporate  accountability  [29],  [30].  Fully  independent  auditcommittee  (non-executives  members)  is  associated  to  outcomes,  andexpected to improve governance with more effective committee [31]. Thisclearly  evidences  that  large  proportion  of  independent  members  in  auditcommittee  ensures  the  effectiveness  of  strategic  management  decision-making.  In  the  same  way,  [32]  observe  that  an  audit  committee  shouldcomprise a higher proportion of non-executive directors. [31] observe thatfull-independent  audit  committee  provides  a  better  monitoring  ofmanagement  than  the  existence  of  executive  members  with  objectivedecision.  The  presence  of  non-executive  directors  in  audit  committeereduces  the  likelihood  of  financial  problem  [7].  Hence,  the  presence  ofindependent directors protects the best interests of shareholders.Independent  audit  committee  protects  its  reputation  by  ensuring  highquality  of  financial  statement  [33].  Moreover,  [32]  find  that  a  negativeassociation  between  the  audit  committee  independence  and  the  goingconcern  of  financially  distressed  companies.  In  other  words,  they  foundthat  the  greater  the  proportion  of  affiliated  directors  on  the  auditcommittee,  the  lower  the  likelihood  the  auditor  will  issue  a  going"

This  circular  requires  the  audit  committee  inLebanese  banks  to  be  including  not  less  than  three  members  fullyindependent; i.e. non-executive directors. Thus, our second hypothesis isdeveloped:H2: There is a significant negative relationship between the compositionof non-executive directors in audit committee and financial distress."

Bymeeting regularly, audit committee provides its effectiveness and ensuresthe  integrity  of  financial  reporting  process  [7].  High  percentage  ofcompanies with non financial reporting problems held meeting four timesa  year.  This  finding  provides  that  audit  committees  in  companies  withfinancial reporting problem, do not hold frequent meetings compared withaudit  committees  in  companies  with  no  financial  reporting  problems.Hence,  prior  research  found  a  positive  relationship  between  frequency"

Hence,  the  meetingfrequency  reduces  any  perceived  audit  and  controls  risk  [38].  Severalaudit  committee  meetings  lead  for  more  serious  steps  to  monitormanagement  by  the  chairman  [34].  Regular  meetings  between  auditcommittee and internal auditors enhance the effectiveness of internal auditfunction  [39].  Internal  audit  is  responsible  to  report  problems  to  auditcommittee,  who,  in  turn,  discusses  and  assesses  the  overall  controlenvironment  with  management,  so  that  proper  actions  are  taken  [40].Thus, our third hypothesis is developed:H3: There is a significant negative relationship between the frequency ofaudit committee meeting and financial distress."

In  terms  of  auditcommittee size, meeting frequency and financial literacy, Lebanese bankscomply  with  the  minimum  requirement  specified  by  the  BDL.  On  theother  side,  the  average  number  of  audit  committee  composition  is  lessthan required by the BDL regulation.In details and without any exception, all banks form the audit committeewith a minimum of three members. Furthermore, 43 out of 149 bank yearof  data  show  that  audit  committees  do  not  totally  include  non-executivemembers. The other sample shows that the audit committee members aretotally independent. 43 banks do not comply with the requirement of BDLto have totally independent members in the audit committee. They, on thecontrary,  comply  with  the  international  regulation  [2]  by  insuring  themajority  of  the  members  to  be  non-executive.

e22,262,418,6,4268,4358,58,539,229,TimesNewRoman,7,"Audit  committee  establishment  decision  is  an  important  determinant  ofgood corporate governance in Lebanese banks. An active audit committeehas a significant impact on the financial performance of the banks. Hence,audit  committee  effectiveness  optimizes  banks  level  performance  beingimportant  keys  in  corporate  governance.  The  effective  audit  committeehelps  management  to  enhance  bank  performance.  This  paper  examinesaudit  committee  characteristics  of  Lebanese  bank  sector  in  relation  tofinancial distress.Findings of this paper show that financial distress is significantly relatedwith  the  meeting  frequency  of  audit  committee  members.  Results  showthat  frequent  meetings  of the audit committee  are  able  to  enhance  banksperformance. Hence, the audit committee with frequent meetings is able tohelp  audit  committee  members  to  fulfill  their  responsibilities.  In  otherwords,  audit  committee  is  able  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  financialreporting,  to  provide  better  monitoring  and  to  review  effectively  theoperations.  However,  the  unavailability  of  individuals  to  hold  highfrequency of meeting poses a problem to the audit committee in order tofulfill  their  responsibility.  In  Lebanese  banks,  our  finding  suggests  thataudit  committees  in  22  of  149  bank  year  of  data  do  not  hold  regularmeetings  per  year.  As  a  result,  the  rule  of  the  BDL  is  approximately"
e22,262,419,6,4268,4358,58,539,229,TimesNewRoman,7,implemented  and  the  availability  of  time  is  a  critical  condition  on  the
e22,262,420,6,4268,4358,58,539,229,TimesNewRoman,7,"appointment  of  audit  committee  members.  To  comply  with  the  BDLrequirement, the audit committee members should be available minimumonce a quarter.Results indicate that there is no significant relationship between financialdistress  and the  other  three  independent  variables;  size,  composition  andfinancial literacy of an audit committee. Hence, on average, the Lebanesebanks  meet  the  minimum  requirements  of  BDL  in  terms  of  size,composition  and  financial  literacy.  This  is  clear  evidence  that  Lebanesebanks comply with regulation to prevent any punitive action taken by theBDL  and  BCCL.  However,  complying  with  these  requirements  is  notenough  to  enhance  banks  performance.  Other  qualitative  factors  haveinfluence  on  audit  committee  performance  [6]  such  as  quality  ofdiscussion  during  meetings,  level  of  commitment  of  audit  committeemembers and organizational work environment.Hence, our findings support the previous studies which have examined therelation  between  audit  committee  characteristics  and  financial  distressparticularly  size,  independence,  meeting  frequency  and  financial  literacy[6],  [7].  Prior  studies  have  examined  the  role  of  audit  committee  in"
e22,262,421,6,4268,4358,58,539,229,TimesNewRoman,7,limiting the power  of  management  and  protecting  shareholders’  interests
e22,262,422,6,4268,4358,58,539,229,TimesNewRoman,7,"[14],  [25].  Hence,  the  board  of  directors  is  responsible  to  establish  aneffective  audit  committee  with  standard  characteristics  with  aim  toguarantee  their  independence  from  management.  In  this  way,  the  auditcommittee  can  fulfill  their  responsibilities  without  any  pressure  frommanagement  and  enhance  corporate  governance  practices.  Any  lack  ofaudit  committee  characteristics  can  hinder  the  banks  to  overcome  theirfinancial  difficulties.  Findings  of  this  paper  show  a  non  significant"
e22,262,423,6,4268,4358,58,539,229,TimesNewRoman,7,"relationship  between  the  banks  size  and  their  financial  distress.  Thissuggests  that  non  importance  of  bank  size  to  enhance  bank  financialperformance.  In  general,  this  research  studies  the  corporate  governancewith  respect  to  audit  committee  characteristics  and  other  factors  such  asaudit quality  and bank  size.  Findings  suggest  that  audit  committee  has asignificant  role  in  enhancing  bank  performance  and  hindering  thefinancial  distress.  Overall,  meeting  frequency  plays  an  important  role  toensure  audit  committee  effectiveness.  The  banks  should  promote  theeffectiveness  of  audit  committee  meeting  by  putting  these  significantissues in their agenda."
e22,263,424,6,4268,4333,302,254,229,TimesNewRoman,7,"This  study  has  a  number  of  limitations.  First,  this  paper  studies  onlyLebanese banks on financially distressed or non-distressed situation. Theresult may not be generalized to other companies (financially distressed ornon-financially  distressed)  which  used  audit  committee.  Moreover,  inLebanon, there is a small number of banks and this may affect the resultsanalysis of statistic data. The implication of this study is this paper doesnot  takeinto  consideration  the  determinants  of  audit  committeecharacteristics  which  may  have  an  influence  on  bank  performance.  Inother word, the degree of control exercised by management may affect theindependence of audit committee over the board of directors and limit theaudit committee to fulfill its responsibilities such as reliability of financialstatement  and  efficiency  of  external  and  internal  audit.  In  this  way,  thedeterminants of audit committee independence may have an influence onbank performance. Hence, the audit committee should tries to limit itselffrom  being  an  instrument  of  management.  Future  studies  concentrate  onthe  impact  of  managerial  dominance  over  the  board  (board  composition,CEO  duality  and  management  ownership)  on  the  independence  of  auditcommittee."

e23,13,28,1,50,371,207,74,354,GulliverRM,7,"Sport event promoters aim to organize them to get the best return on their investment. The purpose ofthis study is to learn better how to manage the event to maximize the beneﬁt to the host area. Moststudies on economic impact of sporting events focus on mega events or look for an impact in medium tolarge size cities. This study estimates the effect of a two-day event, the Rally Ourense, that takes placein a small town in Spain. Economic impact is estimated based on surveys of spectators and interviewsof competitors in the 2009, 2010, and 2011 editions of the rally. The results show that the race hasfavorable effects, but also suggest that the impact could be increased with some simple changes to theevent structure."

e23,16,31,1,50,559,40,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"Sport events are typically regarded as major generators of eco-nomic activity and jobs (Dwyer, Forsyth, & Spurr, 2005). Oftenestimating the economic impact of these events justiﬁes theirimplementation based on economic and social reasons. However,many authors point out that an economic impact assessment alonecannot justify public support for hosting sporting events (Barget &Gouguet, 2011). Furthermore, misinterpretations and miscalcula-tions of these studies are well documented in the literature (Baade& Matheson, 2006; Késenne, 1999; Taks, Kesenne, Chalip, & Green,2011)."

e23,21,38,1,50,559,309,60,251,GulliverRM,7,"The characterization of sports events helps in the selection of themethodology to study impact; Li and Jago (2013) offer a review ofthe most common methods. The classiﬁcation of sport events alsoprovides information on their positive aspects and what to focus onto generate proﬁts, and those facets that are not as beneﬁcial andcan improve or change."
e23,22,39,1,50,622,309,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"To date, the literature on small-scale sport events is sparse(Gibson, Willmin, & Holdnak, 2003; Lee, Harris, & Lyberger, 2010)with the focus of impact studies on large scale or mega-events.The lack of studies of small-scale events is a consequence ofthe difﬁculties in carrying out studies as the size of the eventdecreases, as indicated by Mondello and Rishe (2004) and Matheson(2006). Nevertheless, Higham (1999) and Coates (2012) suggestthat small-scale sports events might have positive effects for hostcommunities. There also are few ex post studies of small events,also because of problems related to their size."

Possibly for thisreason, economic impact studies of these events are not as fre-quent as in other sports. Nevertheless, there are examples like thoseby Hassan and McCulloch (2007) and Hassan and Connor (2009)on rallies, Chmura Economics and Analytics (2011) and Collins,Roberts, and Munday (2012) on cycling events or Barquet, Brida,Osti, and Schubert (2011) and Kruger, Botha, and Saayman (2012)on marathons. This study analyzes an event with these character-istics: a Rally included in the Spanish National Championship thattakes place in an area not densely populated, the Rally Ourense."
e23,28,46,2,910,1090,51,175,251,GulliverRM,7,"There are two main reasons for analyzing this sport event. First,this event happens on a regular basis having been held more than 40times. The authors have collected data for three consecutive yearswhich allow for more accurate inferences about the impact of theevent, and lessons for how to improve its impact. Second, whileit is a small event, it is part of a national competition attractingspectators and competitors from outside the area. Most studies oneconomic impact focus on the estimation of the impact or method-ological issues but they do not extract practical conclusions abouthow to use the study to enhance the event’s creation of value for thehost community. For that reason, the present paper draws expe-riences to design better this kind of analysis and to learn aboutthe key elements on which to act for increasing the value for thearea. Therefore, our study consists not only in the presentation ofthe main results of the economic impact of Rally Ourense for threeyears but how this kind of research could be used as a managementtool by organizers and policy makers."
e23,29,47,2,910,1284,51,7,164,GulliverBL,7,2. Key issues in economic impact studies
e23,30,48,2,910,1305,51,133,251,GulliverRM,7,"Taks et al. (2011) compare and contrast the standard economicimpact analysis (EIA) and a cost-beneﬁt analysis (CBA). They con-sider the opportunity cost, among the costs, and the increase inthe consumption of locals and the consumer surplus on the ben-eﬁt side. Preuss, Könecke, and Schütte (2010) maintain that onlythe spending produced by viewers who stay in town for the eventand visitor spending should be taken into account in the analy-sis as a positive effect. They also remark that there is a negativecash ﬂow when residents travel outside the region for attendingevents. However, gathering the information about the spectatorsthat attend the same kind of event outside the town requires a dif-ferent survey design. Moreover, for a small event in a small town,it is likely that the ﬁgure for travelers is small."
e23,31,49,2,910,1441,51,133,251,GulliverRM,7,"In line with Lee and Taylor (2005) and Baade and Matheson(2006), the direct expenditure should be taken as a starting pointfor calculating the economic impact of a sporting event. This directexpenditure includes spending by the (out-of-town) spectators,competitors and the organizer as generators of economic impact.This study estimates the direct monetary effect of the event. Wedo not attempt to estimate either the opportunity cost or the con-sumer surplus attributed to the event. For a cost-beneﬁt analysis(CBA) of the Rally, both opportunity cost and consumer surplus arenecessary (Taks et al., 2011), but we are only interested in the eco-nomic impact analysis in this study. So, we consider only tangibledirect effects related to cash inﬂows and outﬂows from the mainactors related to the event."
e23,32,50,2,910,1592,51,7,148,GulliverIT,7,2.1. Identifying the sources of cash ﬂows
e23,33,51,2,910,1613,51,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"The ﬁrst step in order to estimate the economic impact of a sportevent is to identify the agents that are going to bring or draw moneyto the selected area of study. In a small event like a Rally, this taskmay be relatively easy as the sources of cash ﬂows are the specta-tors, competitors, media staff, and organizing committee. Of these"
e23,34,52,2,910,975,320,81,251,GulliverRM,7,"four groups, the last three are easily identiﬁed and, in most cases,detailed information about them can be obtained. This is not thecase for the spectators. For them it is necessary to estimate atten-dance. This estimation is simple in an indoor event or an eventwhere the organization sells the seating or standing tickets in aspeciﬁc space. The problem arises in sports like road cycling or ral-lies. In these types of events, the estimation of attendance can be areal challenge."
e23,35,53,2,910,1058,320,112,251,GulliverRM,7,"In most ex ante analyses, attendance may be set using a ruleof thumb. In their assessment of the impact on Richmond, Vir-ginia from hosting the 2015 World Road Cycling Championship,Chmura Economics and Analytics (2011) apply directly the ﬁgurefrom the International Cycling Union (UCI from"

The justiﬁcation is based on the estimationfor the Melbourne Championship in 2010 (300,000 visitors) and asurvey conducted in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, which hosted the2003 World Road Cycling Championships. In the case of Richmond,a more populated area closer to Europe, the UCI increased the ﬁgureto 452,580."

e23,37,63,2,910,1289,320,259,251,GulliverRM,7,"Even though the estimation of the number of spectators can bedifﬁcult in an event like a Rally, there is a method for estimatingthat ﬁgure. The race takes place in branches of roads distant fromthe populated areas. The spectators have to arrive mostly by carto the zones enabled to attend the pass of the competing vehicles.So, an accurate estimation can be done measuring the length of theroads with parked cars in every access to the tranches. Then thenumber of cars can be estimated considering the average length ofa vehicle. Asking the questionnaire about the number of occupantsin the respondent’s cars and multiplying the average occupancyobtained by the estimated number of cars produces an approxi-mate number of spectators for each tranche. Unfortunately, simplyadding together the number of spectators at each tranche couldresult in double, or multiple counting of a single spectator, as anindividual can attend the race in different tranches. Spectators mayview a tranche of the race, then drive off to another location to seeanother tranche. If that person viewed several tranches, he couldbe counted many times in the attendance ﬁgure. For that reason,the survey includes a question asking about the tranches the indi-vidual plans to visit. To avoid this double counting of visitors, wemultiply the total number of attendees by a coefﬁcient that is theratio of the number of non-locals that responded to the survey tothe total number of tranches that they indicated they were goingto visit. So, with this coefﬁcient the number of attendees for eachtranche can be estimates avoiding duplicates."
e23,38,64,2,910,1550,320,91,251,GulliverRM,7,"A further difﬁculty in estimating the non-local attendance arisesbecause the organizers of the Rally, looking to attract spectators,include street shows in the town. With these street shows, anattendee can arrive by foot or public transport which means theestimation of attendees cannot be done in the same way as withthe out of town tranches. Nevertheless, this number can be obtainedfrom the data on the other tranches and the responses in the sur-vey about the intention of attending the race in town using thecoefﬁcient explained in the previous paragraph."

Likewise, a visitor may have been in town foranother purpose and decided to attend the race since it was avail-able. For these reasons, spending from time-switchers and casualshas to be excluded as the race did not attract them to the city.Including their spending would, of course, make the results morepositive. Crompton (1995, 2006) considers counting expendituresfrom time-switchers and casuals as one of the common mistakesin analyzing economic impact."

e23,45,71,3,1771,1982,40,143,251,GulliverRM,7,"In addition to the number of spectators, to estimate the eco-nomic impact of the event it is necessary to have data on the lengthof stays and the average amount spent per person. People are oftenreluctant to answer monetary questions. For that reason, the ques-tionnaire for this study uses a novel design as an attempt to elicit aslarge a response rate as possible to the spending question. Respon-dents were potentially asked three questions about spending. Theﬁrst question asked speciﬁcally about spending on the most com-mon items, lodging, meals, etc. If the person did not want to answerthat question, then the interviewer asked about the total amount ofmoney that the respondent intended to spend in the town. Finally,for those who did not want to answer the second question, a thirdquestion was asked. In this case, the respondent was able to chooseamong several ranges of expenditures."

The number of teams islimited, for that reason it is not difﬁcult to interview a spokespersonfor each team. The interviews include questions about the teamspending in the area. It was expected that the main expenditureswould be accommodation, food and drink, registration fees, petroland spare parts or accessories."

e23,49,75,3,1771,2254,40,60,251,GulliverRM,7,"Mass media plays a fundamental role in an event like the Rally.The staff here includes journalists, photographers, cameramen and,in general, any person authorized by a media provider to cover theevent. As with spectators and competitors, all who travel from outof town generate an economic impact on the community throughthe expenditure incurred during the time they stay in town."
e23,50,76,3,1771,2317,40,123,251,GulliverRM,7,"A different issue is the impact of the event on the media. Spe-cialized companies produce reports which provide estimates of theeconomic value to the city by advertising campaigns on televisionand radio, in the press and via the Internet. These studies attemptto assess the number of viewers, listeners or readers that the mediacoverage of the event produces and the costs of such coverage hadthe local council or government purchased these advertisements.However, these savings are purely theoretical since the local gov-ernment may never have undertaken such campaigns. Moreover,the real beneﬁt of the media coverage is increased visitors in thefuture, something that should be tracked to learn the inﬂuence thatthe media had on tourist spending."

e23,53,79,3,1771,1836,309,28,251,GulliverRM,7,"the area. On the contrary, if all the funds come from local agentsand the organizers spend all the money outside the area, then themaximum loss will occur."
e23,54,80,3,1771,1867,309,81,251,GulliverRM,7,"The information about revenues split by their origin andexpenses identiﬁed by destination is crucial to estimate the impact.There are some companies or institutions that clearly are sited in anexternal area, but in some cases the institution may cover a widerarea that includes the local area. For example, if the regional gov-ernment provides some funds, the town is included in the region.In that sense a pro rata distribution should be done to determinethe proportion of funds that really come from outside the area."
e23,55,81,3,1771,1964,309,7,195,GulliverIT,7,2.3. Estimating the direct monetary economic impact
e23,56,82,3,1771,1985,309,39,251,GulliverRM,7,"Once the direct impact from the different agents involved in theevent has been estimated, the total direct economic impact is justto add those ﬁgures. Table 1 summarizes the different componentsof the direct monetary economic impact."
e23,57,83,3,1771,2041,309,7,132,GulliverIT,7,2.4. Returns from public investment
e23,58,84,3,1771,2062,309,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"The public money invested in the organization of events orbuilding arenas or sports venues has been justiﬁed with eco-nomic impact studies. Crompton (1995) and Coates (2007) identifydoubts about the beneﬁts of funding those facilities with publicmoney. Coates and Humphreys (2008) suggest that economistslargely agree that subsidies for franchises, sport venues andmega-events are undesirable. Even more, Crompton (1995) warnsabout the misapplication of these studies. In the present study,the misuses pointed out by Crompton (1995, 2006) have beenavoided."

Cars compete on closed public roads in “special stages”,leaving from the starting point in regular intervals. Each pilot racesagainst the clock. The course need not be the same from year toyear, either in the distance covered in total or in each section. Forexample, in the 46th edition of the race, the shortest segment was3.1 km and the longest was 29.78 km but in the 44th edition theshortest segment was 2.05 km and the longest was 30.73 km. A fur-ther interesting aspect of the Rally format is that after completinga section of the race in which roads are closed to the public, thecars must drive to another location, obeying trafﬁc laws, to get toanother section closed to the public."

Thatleaves only a small amount of spending on fuel done before andafter the days of the race. Something similar happens with spareparts, tires or accessories. Teams bring with them these items. Tiremanufacturers even attend the championship in order to providethe tires directly to the teams. Finally, the registration fee has tobe excluded to avoid double counting because this money will beincluded among the inﬂows received by the organizing committee.Obviously, the local teams must be excluded in order to correctlycalculate the ﬁnancial inﬂows from which the area will beneﬁt(Table 4)."

e23,168,274,5,3492,3825,40,81,251,GulliverRM,7,"For the 44th Edition of the Rally, 81 media organizations cov-ered the event. This includes 20 newspapers, 9 of them specializedin sport, 16 television stations or TV producers, 7 radio stations,10 photography agencies, 5 press agencies and 23 Internet press.In total 209 persons from these media were registered and 124 ofthem came from outside the city.

Inthe absence of this ﬁgure, one can just employ the same averageexpenditures estimated from the spectators. As the number of jour-nalists is relatively small in comparison to the number of spectators,the effect of a variation on their expenses is not inﬂuential.

This implies that the organizing commit-tee has a negative direct impact (see Table 6). Nevertheless, mostof these expenses cannot be avoided and are necessary. Moreover,some of them cannot be replaced with local suppliers. This is thecase of the payments to the RFEdeA (37.6% of the expenses outsidethe town in the 44th Edition). The"

e23,174,284,5,3492,3741,309,70,251,GulliverRM,7,Table 7 summarizes the direct impact that the Rally Ourensehad on the city during three editions of the race. The largest impactcomes from the spectators though there is a large reduction in spec-tator spending in the 44th edition. This decrease is explained by thefall in the average expenditures (17.9% from

e23,175,289,5,3492,3815,309,143,251,GulliverRM,7,"The study of the weights that the different agents have on thedirect economic impact can shed light on the key elements onwhich to focus for creating value. Table 8 shows that, on average,almost 95% of the direct economic impact has its origin in the spec-tators. Competitors contribute some 5% and the effect from themedia staff about compensates for the negative effect from theevent organizers. In this sense, in order to create more value, orga-nizers should focus their efforts on attracting more spectators fromout of town and in increasing the spending done while attendingthe event. Actions to raise the number of spectators are directly inthe control of the event organizers but increasing average spend-ing will be more difﬁcult for the organizers to affect because mostattendee expenditures are not directly related with the Rally. Forexample, the bulk of visitor spending is for food and lodging."

This happens mostly because the public expenses are lowrelative to the total direct impact from the non-local spectators. Thepublic money funding the event can stay low because it is unnec-essary to invest in venues and because the total budget of the Rallyis small. Over time, as the economic crisis in Spain has grown, thepublic money expended in the Rally decreased 18.0% in the editionof 2011. Moreover, there has been a process of substitution of pri-vate for public funds (the percentage of public money funding theRally in 2009 was 65.5%, 52.5% in 2010 and 51.8% in 2011) (Table 9)."

In the 43rd edition, for the ﬁrst time,Rally Ourense provided an exhibition in the streets of an industrialarea in the town. This exhibition was free for spectators just as iswatching any other segment of the race. The survey for the 43rdand 44th editions of the Rally included a question about the will-ingness to pay to attend the Rally. The results are shown in Table 10.Nearly 60% of the spectators expressed a willingness to pay at the43rd edition, while the ﬁgure rose to 73.7% in the next edition.

e23,244,424,6,4353,4898,51,143,251,GulliverRM,7,"Applying the number of non-local spectators to the percent-age of spectators with a positive willingness to pay produces thenumber of out-of-town spectators with a willingness to pay. Theorganizers could have collected extra revenue that comes fromthe difference between the price that the spectators on averagewould have paid and the ticket price (in the 43rd edition no feeswere charged). Based on this information, the organizers could haveobtained enough revenues from admissions to replace the publicsubsidies. However, it is worth noting that the start of charging toattend the exhibition, the 44th edition of the race, coincides with areduction in the number of spectators and the lowest total inﬂowfrom spectators over the three study years. Better understanding ofwillingness to pay information can be a powerful tool in the eventmanagement process."

The experience of estimating the direct economicimpact of three editions of the Rally Ourense highlights differentissues that must be addressed in impact studies. Namely, theseissues are:"

e23,248,435,6,4353,4627,320,60,251,GulliverRM,7,"Nevertheless, there is a clear advantage when conducting eco-nomic impact studies for these events regarding the informationrequired. Economic impact studies only need to focus on the directimpact. In this way, lack of accurate or appropriate multipliers forthe geographic area of the study is avoided. Furthermore, the riskof exaggerating the economic impact is reduced."
e23,249,436,6,4353,4690,320,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"Regarding practical issues in the methodology, as the spendingby the attendees is a crucial piece of information, a high responserate on spending questions is important. This study tested the useof sequential questions about this spending, each allowing thesurvey respondent to provide a less speciﬁc answer to the toughand highly personal question of how much spending they will do.With these different levels of information speciﬁcity, the study gen-erated a high response rate (over 98% in the last two editions) to thespending question. Importantly, it does not seem that the differentquestions involve large variation in the impact estimated here."

e23,251,442,6,4353,4899,320,70,251,GulliverRM,7,"The economic impact analysis should not be limited to studythe impact of one event for a speciﬁc occasion. An overview of thesteps carried out allows us to identify elements of the event that arecritical in order to increase the economic impact in future editionsof the race. Once these key issues are identiﬁed, it is possible tofocus the organizer’s efforts where they are most proﬁtable for thecity."
e23,252,443,6,4353,4972,320,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"As an example, in the Rally Ourense, and all events, there aretwo critical elements that should be taken into account: the num-ber of spectators and their daily average expenditures. In this case,it is argued that it is easier for event organizers to affect thenumber of spectators, and therefore it is easier to inﬂuence theeconomic impact of the event with policies targeting attendancethan with policies targeting spending per person by attendees.Therefore, organizers and policy makers should design programsintended to attract more spectators during the celebration of theRally."
e23,253,444,6,4353,5077,51,28,251,GulliverRM,7,"Despite widespread use, economic impact studies still are fre-quently misused due to misinterpretations of the results or becausethe limitations of the analysis are not understood. These errors can"

Ofcourse, with charges there might also come a reduction in atten-dees, so organizers should learn as much as possible about spectatorwillingness to pay before embarking on new or higher admissionsfees."
e23,258,449,7,5214,5331,40,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"Finally, given the consistency of the results from the ex postanalysis across the three editions of the Rally, predictions of theimpact of future editions can reasonably be based on these previousresults. As these studies are cheaper in terms of implementation,this would be also an advantage for management purposes."

e24,20,39,2,842,973,51,9,181,TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,9,The understanding and the use of Big Data
e24,21,40,2,842,995,51,53,438,TimesNewRomanPSMT,9,"Big data is a popular phenomenon that aims to provide an alternative to traditional solutions based on databasesand data analysis. Big data is not just about storage or access to data; its solutions aim to  analyze data in order tomake  sense  of  them  and  exploit  their  value.  Big  data  refers  to  datasets  that  are  terabytes  to  petabytes  (and  evenexabytes)  in  size,  and  the  massive  sizes  of  these  datasets  extend  beyond  the  ability  of  average  database  softwaretools to capture, store, manage, and analyze them effectively."
e24,22,41,2,842,1051,51,98,438,TimesNewRoman,9,"The concept of big data has been defined through the 3V model, which was defined in 2001 by Laney as: “high"

e24,22,46,2,842,1051,51,98,438,TimesNewRomanPSMT,9,"definitions refer to the three basic features of big data: Volume, Variety, and Velocity. Other organizations and big"
e24,22,47,2,842,1051,51,98,438,TimesNewRoman,9,data practitioners have extended this 3V model to a 4V model by including a new “V”: Value. This model can be
e24,22,48,2,842,1051,51,98,438,TimesNewRomanPSMT,9,even extended to 5Vs if the concept of Veracity is incorporated into the big data definition [6-9]. The concepts in theenergy sector can be briefly described as follows (Fig. 1):

The benefit from gathering, processing, and analyzing these large amounts ofdata generates a number of challenges in obtaining valuable knowledge for people and companies  [6]. In energysector, the wide deployment of smart metering devices (e.g., smart meters) created massive amounts of data. Forinstance, for a distribution network with 1 million smart meters deployed, the amount of electricity consumptiondata  collected  in  one  year  is  very  large.  According  to  Zhou  ant  other  scientists,  the  amount  of  electricityconsumption data collected by 1  million smart  meters in a distribution  network  within  one  year, the amount ofelectricity consumption data collected once every 15 mins by 1 million smart meters within one year will be up to2920 TB. This presents not only a storage problem, but an analytic problem of making sense of all that data."

e24,77,147,5,3220,3700,43,156,443,TimesNewRomanPSMT,9,"or even a year. The energy consumption behaviors of households in a day often show some differences in differenttimes of the day. In contrast, the monthly and annual energy consumption behaviors are usually affected by manyexternal factors [3-5]. In the user dimension (Fig. 4), the energy consumption behaviors of different households alsovary greatly. Individual's energy use behavior is generally influenced by various factors, including both internal andexternal  ones.  Internal  factors  are  the  subjective  intentions,  such  as  habit  and  environmental  awareness.  Externalfactors mainly include housing characteristics, demographic characteristics, way of working, and other factors [3-5].Other  problem  is  that  big  data  become  bigger  and  bigger.  The  Web  log  records  millions  of  visits  a  day  to  ahandful of pages; the cellphone database stores time and location every 15 seconds for each of a few million phones;the retailer has  thousands of stores, tens of thousands of products, and millions of customers but logs billions andbillions  of  individual  transactions  in  a  year.

e24,81,152,6,4013,4123,45,90,452,TimesNewRomanPSMT,9,"Another major challenge for data analysis is exemplified by applications with hard limits on the size of data theycan  handle.

e28,21,46,2,842,896,41,7,101,AdvGulliv-I,7,1.1. Tax and dividend policy
e28,22,47,2,842,917,41,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Miller and Modigliani (1961) show that in a perfect market and without taxes, dividend policy does not affect ﬁrm value.They also acknowledge that there are many factors that can make a ﬁrm’s dividend policy value-relevant and that an impor-tant one is tax. They state that ‘‘Of all the market imperfections that might be detailed, the only one that would seem to beeven remotely capable of producing such a concentration is the substantial advantage accorded to capital gains as comparedwith dividends under the personal income tax.’’ Apparently, in maintaining their dividend irrelevancy story, they try todiscount the role of taxes."
e28,23,48,2,842,980,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Subsequent researchers have incorporated the differential taxation of dividends versus capital gains in stock return mod-els, such as Brennan (1970) and Litzenberger and Ramaswamy (1979, 1980, 1982). If dividends are taxed at a higher ratethan capital gains, such as in the United States, then stock returns should increase with dividend yield. This is the conceptof dividend tax capitalization. That is, in equilibrium, investors will have to be compensated for investing in an asset or astream of income that is more heavily taxed."
e28,24,49,2,842,1045,41,7,106,AdvGulliv-I,7,1.2. Tax and capital structure
e28,25,50,2,842,1066,41,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Modigliani and Miller (1958) show that without taxes, a ﬁrm’s capital structure does not affect its value but there is an"
e28,25,51,2,842,1066,41,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"equity risk premium associated with leverage. In their attempt to incorporate corporate taxes, they make a mistake by takingit for granted that corporate taxes just affect ﬁrm value and therefore stock returns proportionately. This is not the case.Modigliani and Miller (1963) correct this oversight. This episode, however, should help us better appreciate the importanceof taxes in capital market research. They show that with corporate taxes and the tax deductibility of interest expense, ﬁrmvalue increases and the leverage-induced risk premium decreases."
e28,26,52,2,842,1129,41,70,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Miller (1977) further introduces personal level taxes for both debt income and equity income and shows that they alsoaffect ﬁrm value through ﬁnancial leverage. Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) and Miller (1977) predict that with a corpo-rate tax, ﬁnancial leverage increases ﬁrm value. However, when debt income is taxed at a relatively higher rate than equityincome, the value enhancing role of ﬁnancial leverage is mitigated. If we invert Miller (1977) into a cost of equity capitalmodel, then we have three predictions. First, a ﬁrm’s cost of equity capital increases with ﬁnancial leverage. Second, theleverage induced equity premium is negatively associated with the corporate tax rate. Third, the leverage induced equitypremium increases with the relative taxation of debt income versus equity income."

e28,29,55,2,842,1259,41,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Differential taxation of dividends versus capital gains affects a ﬁrm’s dividend policy. For example, high dividend yieldﬁrms attract investors with a low tax rate on dividend income and low dividend yield ﬁrms attract investors with a hightax rate on dividend income. This relation can also go the other way around. Investors with a low tax rate on dividend in-come induce ﬁrms to pay more dividends and investors with a high tax rate on dividend income induce ﬁrms to pay lessdividends. This is called the dividend tax clientele effect. Elton and Gruber (1970), Grullon and Michaely (2002) and Grinsteinand Michaely (2005) and many others ﬁnd evidence supporting this clientele effect."

e28,61,220,3,1635,1986,36,112,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"A practical way of examining the effect of tax-induced heterogeneity on ex-dividend trading volume is to assume thatthere are roughly two types of investors in the market, individual investors and institutional investors. In the US setting,institutional investors are more likely than individual investors to prefer dividends over capital gains. In fact, as long as insti-tutional investors and individual investors differ in their tax preferences for dividends versus capital gains, they can trade ina certain fashion to reduce their tax burdens and therefore drive up trading volume. The intuition is rather simple. When thelevel of institutional ownership is relatively low, tax induced tax heterogeneity is low (everyone is an individual investor)and trading volume will be low. When the level of institutional ownership is relatively high, tax induced heterogeneity isagain low (everyone is an institutional investor) and trading volume will be low. When the level of institutional ownershipis in between these extremes, tax induced heterogeneity is high (a combination of individual and institutional investors) andtrading volume will be high. Therefore, trading volume is an increasing and concave function of institutional ownership(Dhaliwal and Li, 2006) as reﬂected in the following equation:"

Using high frequency data and estimating the directions of trades and the identitiesof traders, he ﬁnds that institutional investors are more likely to capture dividends by buying shares before they go ex-div-idend than individual investors.

e28,85,382,4,2428,2675,41,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Capital gains tax has its own unique research implications. Capital gains tax is only levied when investors sell an asset andon the realized appreciation of the asset. A mere appreciation in value of an asset in an investor’s investment portfolio doesnot trigger capital gains taxes. When an investor considers the selling of an asset, he has to take into account the tax cost ofselling the asset. Selling will accelerate the realization of capital gains taxes making the investor reluctant to sell. This causesa reduction in the supply of that asset in the market and an increase in its price (Klein, 1999; Viard, 2000). This is called thelock-in effect of capital gains taxes."
e28,86,383,4,2428,2738,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Of course, with perfect tax capitalization when the investor initially acquires the asset, lock-in need not happen. However,when we have unexpected price appreciations (George and Hwang, 2007), unexpected capital gains tax rate changes (Daiet al., 2008), transitions from short-term capital gains to long-term capital gains (Reese, 1998), or incomplete initial capital-ization, lock-in can happen when an investor considers the sale of an asset. Evidence on the lock-in effect would demonstratethat tax is an important cost of holding an asset."
e28,87,384,4,2428,2803,41,7,82,AdvGulliv-I,7,2.4. Tax aggressiveness
e28,88,385,4,2428,2823,41,70,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Tax aggressiveness is a line of literature that has gained a lot of attention lately. In the US, ﬁrm managers prepare ﬁnancialstatements based on GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and tax returns based on the IRC (Internal RevenueCode). GAAP and the IRC are often different from each other, causing a divergence between income based on GAAP and in-come based on the IRC (a book-tax difference). Firm managers also actively manage GAAP income upward and taxable in-come downward, further widening this divergence or book-tax difference. Therefore, a ﬁrm’s tax aggressiveness is reﬂectedin its magnitude of book-tax difference or effective tax rate (Dyreng et al., 2008). It can also be reﬂected in its use of tax shel-ters (Wilson, 2009)."
e28,89,386,4,2428,2897,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Hanlon (2002) shows that ﬁrms with large book-tax differences have less persistent earnings. Tax aggressiveness also af-fects ﬁrm value. Desai and Dharmapala (2006, 2009) argue that tax aggressiveness is associated with agency costs. In ﬁrms"
e28,89,387,4,2428,2897,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"with poor corporate governance, tax aggressiveness destroys ﬁrm value. Chen et al. (2010) show that a unique agency con-ﬂict between dominant and small shareholders in family ﬁrms causes them to be less tax aggressive. Graham and Tucker(2006) show that tax aggressiveness (use of tax shelters), as a form of non-debt tax shield, also reduces ﬁrms’ borrowing."

e28,92,390,4,2428,3005,41,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"A lot of China-related tax research has focused on how changes in tax policies affect ﬁrms’ capital structure. For a periodof time, Chinese ﬁrms’ capital structure has been thought to be set exogenously and constrained largely by ideology and gov-ernment control. This is especially true at the time a ﬁrm is established and publicly listed. However, with the developmentof China’s reforms and capital markets, more and more ﬁrms are using market mechanisms to compete for resources. There-fore, the formation of ﬁrms’ capital structures has evolved into an endogenous process. A few important tax policy changeshave provided great settings for tax research in China."
e28,93,391,4,2428,3068,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"In 2000, the central government rescinded the so-called ‘‘tax-and-refund’’ preferential tax treatment to listed ﬁrms. Therescission started in 2002. ‘‘Tax-and-refund’’ means that while the central taxing authorities will tax ﬁrms at 33%, local gov-ernments will refund 18% of the taxes to ﬁrms. A purpose of this policy is to assist local ﬁrms’ competitiveness when they do"
e28,93,392,4,2428,3068,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"not receive preferential tax treatment from the central government. The rescission of this policy effectively increases manyﬁrms’ corporate tax rates. Based on Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963), ﬁrms will increase their reliance on debt in order to"

Wu and Yue (2006) ﬁnd that while before the rescission of ‘‘tax-and-refund’’, there is no signiﬁcant difference in ﬁnancial leverage between ﬁrms that enjoy this tax beneﬁt and ﬁrms that donot enjoy this tax beneﬁt, after the rescission, ﬁrms that formerly enjoy this beneﬁt start to increase their ﬁnancial leverage.The new 2008 Corporate Tax Act uniﬁes tax rates for domestic and foreign ﬁrms in China. Before 2008, domestic ﬁrmswere taxed at 33% while foreign ﬁrms and others that received preferential tax treatment were taxed at 15%. After 2008,tax rates for these ﬁrms gradually converge to 25%. In other words, the tax rate for domestic ﬁrms formerly not receivingpreferential tax treatment decreases while that for foreign ﬁrms or ﬁrms formerly receiving preferential tax treatmentincreases. Therefore, ﬁnancial leverage should decrease for ﬁrms formerly not receiving preferential tax treatment and itshould increase for foreign ﬁrms and ﬁrms formerly receiving preferential tax treatment. Wang et al. (2010) ﬁnd results sup-porting these predictions."
e28,97,396,5,3220,3379,36,91,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"In examining the effect of tax regime changes on capital structure, Chinese ﬁrms’ ownership structure offers a specialtwist. State ownership affects ﬁrm behavior and value and therefore the effect of tax regime changes differently fromnon-state-owned ﬁrms. Firms with high state ownership tend to have a closer relationship with the government and there-fore tend to shoulder more social responsibilities, including paying more corporate taxes (Wu, 2009). Further, these ﬁrms areless likely to incorporate ﬁrm value maximization in their decision making process when pursuing social responsibilities. Infact, to the government, both the proﬁts of state-owned ﬁrms and the taxes that they pay represent increases in governmentwealth. Therefore, state-owned ﬁrms have lower incentives to managing their tax bills than non-state-owned ﬁrms. Wanget al. (2010) ﬁnd that after the 2008 tax act, state-owned ﬁrms are less sensitive to the change in the debt tax shield thannon-state-owned ﬁrms."
e28,98,397,5,3220,3484,36,7,97,AdvGulliv-I,7,3.2. Unique topics in China
e28,99,398,5,3220,3505,36,28,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Of course, the above examples are largely based on MM theories. It is important to keep in mind that China is very dif-ferent and unique from more developed western economies. Reasoning based on western economies often does not workproperly in China. However, this only adds glamour to China research."
e28,100,399,5,3220,3536,36,39,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"For example, taxation in China is sometimes not directly dependent on a ﬁrm’s income or revenue. Every year, tax willincrease by a predetermined percentage set at the beginning of the year regardless of a ﬁrm’s performance. Miraculously,this target is often met. It would be an extremely interesting topic to examine how ﬁrms negotiate their tax liabilities withthe government."
e28,101,400,5,3220,3578,36,102,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Further, during the last three decades, China went through many regulatory and law changes, a lot of which involved taxlaws and ﬁnancial reporting. China used to have almost perfect book-tax conformity. However, with convergence towardsIFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) and the 2000 Corporate Income Tax Act, book-tax differences have in-creased. Earnings and tax management further increases the gap between book income and taxable income. Managers haveto balance ﬁnancial reporting costs and tax costs in their decision making process. For example, China’s tax law does notallow a deduction for inventory devaluation. When a ﬁrm decides to increase earnings through a reduction in the allowancefor inventory devaluation, taxable income is unchanged. Therefore, ﬁrms may manage non-taxable items to reduce the taxcosts of earnings management. This phenomenon is more pronounced for ﬁrms in high tax brackets than for ﬁrms receivingpreferential tax treatment (Ye, 2006). Large book-tax differences may also suggest that ﬁrms have low accounting quality.Wu and Li (2007) ﬁnd that earnings persistence is lower for ﬁrms with large book-tax differences."
e28,102,401,5,3220,3682,36,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Large tax law changes also provide opportunities for examining tax-induced earnings management. Using the 2008 TaxAct as an example, tax rate changes affect different ﬁrms differently. Firms whose tax rates are expected to decrease maydelay earnings recognition. The case for ﬁrms whose tax rates are expected to increase may not be that obvious. Because"
e28,102,402,5,3220,3682,36,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"tax rates increase gradually, these ﬁrms have to balance the beneﬁt of a lower tax rate now and time discounted tax liabil-ities in the future. The incentive to accelerate earnings recognition is less pronounced. Wang et al. (2009) ﬁnd results sup-porting these predictions."
e28,103,403,5,3220,3745,36,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"From a different angle, Chan et al. (2010) investigate whether departure from a tax-based accounting system towards IFRSconvergence in China encourages tax noncompliance and whether weakened book-tax conformity affects the informative-ness of book-tax differences for tax noncompliance. They ﬁnd that as book-tax conformity decreases, tax noncompliance in-creases and that the informativeness of book-tax differences on tax noncompliance attenuates as book-tax conformityweakens. This is an excellent study that utilizes regime changes in taxation and ﬁnancial reporting."
e28,104,404,5,3220,3798,36,28,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"China’s recent reform on wage deductions for tax purposes can also provide a lot of research opportunities. This reform canhave a deep impact on ﬁrm’s cost of capital, ﬁnancial leverage, labor costs, etc. While wages are always deductible in the US andother western economies, the lack of a regime change makes empirical analysis difﬁcult to perform in these countries."

Firm-speciﬁc events include earnings announcements, ex-dividend days,management earnings guidance, etc. Common events include reporting and disclosure rule changes, tax regime changes, etc."

But if tax takes away 30% of our earnings, it is going to have a major impact on our behavior andattitudes. In many situations, its impact is likely big.

e28,112,413,6,4013,4162,41,81,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"There are many examples. Elton and Gruber (1970) provide a tax answer to why stock prices do not drop by the amount ofdividends. We already know that the debt tax shield increase ﬁrm value. However, the presence of non-debt tax shields cancrowd out the effect of debt, making it less effective in enhancing ﬁrm value. Graham and Tucker (2006) show that tax shel-ters can be a non-debt tax shield that can reduce debt usage and explain why ﬁrms sometimes use debt sparingly. In fact, anydeduction can be a non-debt tax shield, wages, stock options, etc. If it is large, it can affect ﬁrms’ debt usage and value. Taxescan even explain long-term reversals in stock returns. George and Hwang (2007) show that investors’ rational reactions tolocked-in capital gains better explain long-term reversals in US stock returns than irrational overreaction to news. In HongKong where capital gains are not taxed, reversals are nonexistent."
e28,113,414,6,4013,4246,41,39,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"So keep tax in mind when looking for answers. If family ownership affects tax aggressiveness, then maybe organized laborcan also affect tax aggressiveness. If tax aggressiveness affects equity value, then maybe it also affects debt pricing and cov-enant restrictions. If tax law changes affect earnings management incentives, then maybe they also affect employment andlabor costs."

e28,116,417,6,4013,4354,41,91,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Currently, much of the accounting research revolves around the US. For example, theories are formulated based on USinstitutional settings and empirical analysis is based on US data. Recently, China researchers have certainly eked out a nicheof China research following paradigms developed in western economies such as the US. However, we believe that the viewthat China research has to be based on western theories and provides a setting that is not available in the west but is con-ducive to testing westerns theories is perhaps wrong. If this is the case, then China research serves only to provide externalvalidity for western theories and we lack legitimacy for our own research. China’s success and failure stories are differentfrom those from more developed economies. Or, researchers have not developed a theory general enough to explain all phe-nomena in all economies, developed or developing.

e29,18,31,1,50,581,51,133,251,GulliverRM,7,"initiatives have becomeincreasingly popular among organizations. This strategy impliessupporting a social cause to promote the achievement of marketingobjectives (Barone, Norman, & Miyazaki, 2000). CRM implementa-tion can be undertaken in different forms (Gupta & Pirsch, 2006a;Liu & Ko, 2011). One of the most common forms involves the dona-tion of a portion of the corporation’s proﬁts from each productsold to a cause. In this sense, CRM is deﬁned by Varadarajan andMenon (1988, p. 60) as “the process of formulating and implemen-ting marketing activities that are characterized by an offer fromthe ﬁrm to contribute a speciﬁed amount to a designated causewhen customers engage in revenue-providing exchanges that sat-isfy organizational and individual objectives”."

e29,21,36,1,50,560,320,175,251,GulliverRM,7,"Supporting a speciﬁc cause can have several advantages. Forinstance, cause marketing programmes allow companies to createa link with customers and show a commitment to social respon-sibility. Unlike other marketing communications tools, CRM isalso a powerful way to reach consumers on an emotional level(Roy, 2010). This promotional strategy can improve and sustain afavourable image and reputation among consumers, establish dif-ferentiation from competitors and add value to the brand (Brown &Dacin, 1997; Wymer & Samu, 2009). All these beneﬁts can, in sum,positively inﬂuence consumer attitude and purchase behaviour.However, recent research has shown that, compared to other cor-porate social responsibility (CSR) actions, such as sponsorship orphilanthropy, CRM activities are more likely to be viewed with sus-picion (Lii & Lee, 2012; Sheikh & Beise-Zee, 2011), as CRM initiativesgenerally require consumers to make a purchase; therefore, the linkbetween the cause and the company’s proﬁts can result in a lessfavourable evaluation."
e29,22,37,1,50,738,320,28,251,GulliverRM,7,"Given the relevance and business emphasis on using CRM ini-tiatives, it is important to explore the main factors associated withsuccessful CRM campaigns. Among the multiple factors that may"

e29,26,42,2,910,975,40,217,251,GulliverRM,7,"have a bearing on the effectiveness of CRM, two are of particu-lar interest: the type of product and the perceived ﬁt between theproduct and the cause. The evaluation of CRM initiatives is likelyto depend on the type of product used (i.e. hedonic vs. utilitarian)(Strahilevitz & Myers, 1998). Likewise, perceived ﬁt, which refersto the degree of proximity or congruence between the product andthe cause, has been assumed to be one of the most inﬂuential withrespect to the ultimate success of the partnership (Lafferty, 2007).Controversy exists, however, regarding the inﬂuence of these vari-ables. For instance, while some authors have found that consumerresponse to CRM is more favourable when the products are hedonicrather that utilitarian (Strahilevitz & Myers, 1998), others have notreplicated these results (Subrahmanyan, 2004; Wymer & Samu,2009). Likewise, advice on the level of ﬁt between the productand the cause is mixed, with some calling for a high level of ﬁtand others advocating a moderate or low product-cause ﬁt level(Barone et al., 2000). In addition, both factors (the type of prod-uct and perceived ﬁt) can simultaneously inﬂuence three levelsof consumer response: cognitive, affective and behavioural (Roy,2010). Research, however, has generally addressed the analysis ofconsumer responses individually."
e29,27,43,2,910,1194,40,81,251,GulliverRM,7,"In this context, this study assesses whether the nature of theproduct and the ﬁt between the product and the cause inﬂu-ence: (1) the credibility of the CRM campaign (cognitive consumerresponse); (2) the attitude towards the brand (affective consumerresponse); and, (3) the purchase intention (behavioural consumerresponse). In addition, we aim at comparing the nature of the prod-uct, that is to say, hedonic and utilitarian products in order to betterunderstand the results of this study."
e29,28,44,2,910,1278,40,70,251,GulliverRM,7,"The remainder of the article is organized as follows. First,we present the theoretical background of the study and for-mulate the hypotheses. We then describe the research method,followed by an analysis of the empirical results. Finally, conclu-sions and implications for researchers and managers are provided,along with the limitations of the study and directions for futureresearch."
e29,29,45,2,910,1383,40,7,69,GulliverBL,7,Literature review
e29,30,46,2,910,1404,40,70,251,GulliverRM,7,"As with other managerially controllable factors, such as price,distribution and advertising, CRM campaigns inﬂuence cognitive,affective, and behavioural consumer responses (He, Zhu, Gouran, &Kolo, 2016; Huertas-García, Gázquez-Abad, & Lengler, 2014; Roy,2010). To increase the efﬁcacy of CRM, the growing literature on thistopic has analyzed the impact that several factors have on consumerresponses to these initiatives."
e29,31,47,2,910,1477,40,185,251,GulliverRM,7,"For instance, some authors have studied cause characteristics,such as the familiarity, the importance and the geographic scope ofthe cause (Cui, Trent, Sullivan, & Matiru, 2003; Grau & Folse, 2007;Hou, Du, & Li, 2008; Lafferty & Edmondson, 2009). Researchers havealso explored the role of the variables related to the campaigns, suchas the donation size (Chang, 2008; Moosmayer & Fuljahn, 2010;Pracejus, Olsen, & Brown, 2003, 2004), the clarity of the message(Simmons & Becker-Olsen, 2006), the dominance or emphasis givento the cause in the message (Samu & Wymer, 2009), or the dura-tion of the campaign and the amount of resources invested (vanden Brink, Odekerken-Schröder, & Pauwels, 2006). Similarly, otherresearchers have analyzed the inﬂuence of characteristics relat-ing to the company, such as its corporate credibility (Kim, Kim,& Han, 2005; Lafferty, 2007), or related to the non-proﬁt organi-zation, such as its image (Arora & Henderson, 2007). Finally, otherauthors have examined the impact of consumer characteristics ontheir responses to CRM, such as consumer scepticism (Vanhamme& Grobben, 2009), concern for appearances (Basil & Weber, 2006),"
e29,32,48,2,910,975,309,18,251,GulliverRM,7,"consumers’ temporal orientation (Tangari, Folse, Burton, & Kees,2010) and other socio-demographic variables (Cui et al., 2003)."
e29,33,49,2,910,996,309,154,251,GulliverRM,7,"While these previous studies have offered new insights intoconsumer responses to CRM, there is a general consensus amongscholars that more research is needed (Aldás, Andreu, & Currás,2013; Lafferty & Edmondson, 2009). Speciﬁcally, among the mul-tiple variables that may affect the inﬂuence of a CRM programme,two are of particular interest: the nature of the product, and theﬁt between the product and the cause. These variables have beenidentiﬁed in prior research as potentially relevant factors inﬂu-encing CRM success (Lafferty, 2007; Strahilevitz & Myers, 1998).However, as noted earlier, the results are still controversial. Inaddition, as these variables are under companies’ control, theyare relevant to managers when designing CRM campaigns. In thenext section, we explore how these two variables may inﬂuencecognitive, affective and behavioural consumer responses to CRMprogrammes."
e29,34,50,2,910,1165,309,7,162,GulliverIT,7,Nature of the product: hedonic vs. utilitarian
e29,35,51,2,910,1186,309,81,251,GulliverRM,7,"The evaluation of CRM initiatives is likely to depend on the typeof product used (i.e. hedonic vs. utilitarian). While hedonic prod-ucts, such as ice cream, chocolates or concert tickets, are generallylinked to experiential consumption, utilitarian products, such aslaundry detergent or toothpaste, are viewed as more functional andinstrumental. Therefore, hedonic products are judged in terms ofhow much pleasure they provide, whereas utilitarian products arejudged in terms of how well they function."
e29,36,52,2,910,1270,309,206,251,GulliverRM,7,"Previous research has shown that the success of CRM campaignsis higher when the strategy is used with hedonic products ratherthan utilitarian ones (Chang, 2008; Strahilevitz & Myers, 1998). Forinstance, Strahilevitz and Myers (1998) found that donations tocharity were more effective for promoting frivolous products (i.e.hedonic products) than in promoting practical products (i.e. util-itarian products). On the contrary, monetary incentives (i.e. pricediscounts) were preferred when they were bundled with utilitar-ian or practical products. This result can be explained by the factthat hedonic products are more likely than utilitarian products toarouse both pleasure and guilt (Kivetz & Simonson, 2002; Zheng &Kivetz, 2009). According to the ﬁeld of social psychology, guilt is anegative emotion that a person may wish to overcome by means ofsome prosocial behaviour (e.g. Batson & Coke, 1981). Therefore, thefeeling of guilt can be mitigated if the hedonic purchase is linkedto a cause. In contrast, CRM campaigns linked to practical productstend to generate fewer emotional responses. Thus, the evaluationand purchase decisions for these types of products are usually morerational and focused on cues related to the product itself (Chang,2008)."
e29,37,53,2,910,1479,309,39,251,GulliverRM,7,"Based on the reasoning above, it is expected that consumerswill demonstrate more positive cognitive, affective and behaviouralresponses when CRM initiatives are used in hedonic products.Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:"

e29,38,55,2,910,1527,309,28,251,GulliverRM,7,CRM linked to hedonic products (vs. utilitarian) will leadto: (a) higher campaign credibility; (b) a more positive attitudetowards the brand; and (c) higher purchase intention.
e29,39,56,2,910,1571,309,7,173,GulliverIT,7,Perceived ﬁt between the product and the cause
e29,40,57,2,910,1592,309,70,251,GulliverRM,7,"Perceived ﬁt refers to the perceived degree of proximity orcongruence between the promoted product and the cause. Theinﬂuence of perceived ﬁt has been studied within multiple researchstreams in marketing, such as brand extensions (e.g. Aaker & Keller,1990; De Jong & van der Meer, 2015; Völckner & Sattler, 2006),co-branding (Simonin & Ruth, 1998), corporate social responsi-bility (CSR) (Bigné, Currás-Pérez, & Aldás-Manzano, 2012; Pérez"

e29,43,60,3,1771,1836,51,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"& Rodríguez del Bosque, 2013) and sponsorships (Simmons &Becker-Olsen, 2006; Speed & Thompson, 2000). Drawing from thisliterature, previous studies have also analyzed the importance of ﬁtwith respect to the CRM campaign’s success (Bigné-Alca ˜niz, Currás-Pérez, Ruiz-Mafé, & Sanz-Blas, 2012; Kuo & Rice, 2015)."
e29,44,61,3,1771,1888,51,123,251,GulliverRM,7,"In order to achieve suitable results Lafferty, Goldsmith, & Hult(2004, p. 512) recommend distinguishing between functional andbrand ﬁt. Product-category is considered a functional ﬁt and it isdetermined in function of the characteristics, attributes and func-tions of the type of product of the brand and the type of social causesupported. Brand-name ﬁt refers to how comfortable consumersare with the cause-brand pairing and it is related with the congru-ence between the image of the brand and the social cause. More,the same brand may have different product categories. Consider-ing differences between types of ﬁt is necessary as these two typesof ﬁt may have different inﬂuence on consumer perceptions andattitudes (Bigné et al., 2012)."
e29,45,62,3,1771,2013,51,70,251,GulliverRM,7,"However, unfortunately literature too often has not differenti-ated between functional (product category) and brand (image) ﬁts.This misunderstanding can be the reason of identifying ambiva-lent results in former researches, and for such reason withinthe CRM literature, there is a lack of consensus regarding thelevel of ﬁt a brand, product or company should have with acause."
e29,46,63,3,1771,2087,51,279,251,GulliverRM,7,"While some researchers posit that high perceived ﬁt improvesthe results of campaigns, others suggest that low ﬁt is more effec-tive. Speciﬁcally, some studies have found that high perceived ﬁtcan negatively inﬂuence consumers’ brand perceptions. This neg-ative effect is due to the fact that CRM campaigns with high ﬁtcan be viewed by consumers as opportunistic (Drumwright, 1996;Ellen, Mohr, & Webb, 2000). However, most works have revealedthe opposite. In general, high ﬁt has been proven to positively affectdifferent factors, such as product choice (Pracejus & Olsen, 2004;Strahilevitz & Myers, 1998), attitude towards the brand (Bigné-Alca ˜niz, Currás-Pérez, & Sánchez-García, 2009; Samu & Wymer,2009), and attitude towards the campaign (Barone et al., 2000).As such, higher levels of perceived ﬁt between the product andthe cause will lead consumers to perceive the company as beingmore expert, and favour the transfer of positive feelings and beliefsabout the cause to the brand (Ellen, Webb, & Mohr, 2006; Hoefﬂer& Keller, 2002). Likewise, a high ﬁt can explain why an organiza-tion is supporting a cause (Sheikh & Beise-Zee, 2011). Therefore,it is suggested that higher levels of ﬁt will improve the credibilityof the association between the company and the cause, as well asthe consumers’ attitudes and purchase intentions (Gupta & Pirsch,2006b; Pracejus & Olsen, 2004; Samu & Wymer, 2009). In contrast,lower levels of ﬁt are likely to generate weaker attributions of thebrand’s motive and perceptions of brand credibility, and lead tonegative attitudes towards the brand (Becker-Olsen, Cudmore, &Hill, 2006; Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004).

e29,141,349,5,3492,4195,51,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"Given the fact that companies are operating under increas-ing competition, they need to differentiate, reach new customers,enhance their corporate image and generate incremental sales. Inaddition, they need to engage in socially responsible behaviours. Inthis context, CRM is seen as a way for companies to achieve both"
e29,142,350,5,3492,3891,320,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"corporate and nonproﬁt objectives (Samu & Wymer, 2009). Con-sumers’ responses to CRM practices are complex. Therefore, thispaper analyzes the inﬂuence of two determinants that may con-dition the success of a CRM campaign: the product type and theperceived ﬁt between the product and the cause."
e29,143,351,5,3492,3943,320,300,251,GulliverRM,7,"Trying to solve the ambiguity identifying in former studieswe have adopted the proposal made by authors such as Laffertyet al. (2004) and Bigné et al. (2012). Our results must be consid-ered under the functional ﬁt. Our data revealed that product typehad a signiﬁcant main effect on the consumer response variablesincluded in the analyses. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁndings showed that theutilitarian or hedonic character of the product used in the CRMcampaign inﬂuences both brand attitude and purchase intention.As proposed in previous research, attitude towards the brand wasgreater for the hedonic products than for the utilitarian ones. Incontrast, despite the fact that some studies have suggested thatCRM used in hedonic products should enhance purchase inten-tion, this was not the case in this study. Previous literature suggeststhat the feeling of guilt evoked by the purchase of hedonic prod-ucts can be tempered when the hedonic purchase is linked to acause (Strahilevitz & Myers, 1998). However, in our study, con-trary to what was expected, CRM linked to utilitarian (vs. hedonic)products lead to higher purchase intention. This ﬁnding is consis-tent with other recent studies (Roy, 2010; Subrahmanyan, 2004).The experiential beneﬁts generated by the cause may explain thisﬁnding. CRM campaigns generate emotional arousal and affectivebeneﬁts. The addition of these beneﬁts to the expected func-tional beneﬁts of the utilitarian products may enhance their overallperceived value (Lim & Ang, 2008) and, consequently, their pur-chase intentions. Further, the consumption of utilitarian productsis typically rational, cognitively driven and goal oriented (Roy &Ng, 2012). These characteristics may make consumers more awareof the need to help causes, thereby increasing their purchaseintentions."

e29,146,354,6,4353,4418,40,238,251,GulliverRM,7,"Likewise, perceived ﬁt between the product and the cause seemsto play a key role. Perceived ﬁt had a signiﬁcant effect on both thecredibility of the campaign and the attitude towards the brand.In contrast, a high level of ﬁt did not have any signiﬁcant effecton purchase intention. Extant literature has widely discussed theinﬂuence of the perceived ﬁt between the product and the causeon consumer response. Although most researchers advocate a highproduct-cause ﬁt level, others call for a moderate or low level of ﬁt(Drumwright, 1996). Several researchers have not supported thathigher levels of ﬁt can improve consumer responses to CRM cam-paigns (e.g. Lafferty, 2007; Nan & Heo, 2007). Our results showthat ﬁt has a signiﬁcant effect on both the cognitive and affec-tive level of the consumer response. When consumers perceive ahigh ﬁt, the campaign is more credible. In addition, the beliefs andaffect associated with the cause might be transferred to the brand,thus improving consumers’ perceptions towards it. The ﬁndings inthis study suggest that perceived ﬁt between the product and thecause, in contrast, does not play a key role in terms of inﬂuencingthe behavioural level of the consumer response. As Lafferty (2007)explains, other variables, such as the congruence among the indi-viduals and the ﬁrm, can inﬂuence the purchase intent. Therefore,two CRM campaigns with different levels of ﬁt could get similareffects."
e29,147,355,6,4353,4658,40,175,251,GulliverRM,7,"The research ﬁndings have several managerial implications.Our ﬁndings related to the effects of type of product on con-sumer responses were intriguing. The cognitive response was notaffected by this factor. Therefore, the nature of the product doesnot appear to be a relevant determinant of the credibility of thecampaign. In contrast, while the affective response, measuredthrough the brand attitude, was higher for hedonic products, thebehavioural response, measured through purchase intentions, wasslightly higher for utilitarian products. These mixed results couldsuggest that CRM campaigns are not only suitable for hedonic prod-ucts, as has usually been proposed in the literature, but also forutilitarian products. Indeed, our ﬁndings show that linking a CRMcampaign to a utilitarian product may be more effective in inﬂu-encing purchase intentions. Therefore, marketers selling hedonicproducts can beneﬁt from a more favourable attitude towards theirbrands, whereas marketers selling utilitarian products can beneﬁtfrom higher purchase intentions."

It is interesting to note, however, that according tothe results of our study, a CRM campaign with high product-causeﬁt, compared with one of low ﬁt, is more effective in inﬂuenc-ing the credibility of the campaign and the attitude towards thebrand. Therefore, the perceived ﬁt between the cause and theproduct does appear to be relevant. As such, marketing managersshould acknowledge the importance of linking their products withcongruent causes. Some consumers are sceptical about the ﬁrms’objectives when using CRM alliances. Therefore, higher ﬁt canreduce this scepticism and increase the credibility of the campaign.Similarly, as most managers seek to maintain and reinforce positiveattitude towards their brands, linking their brands to CRM initia-tives appears to be a wise alternative to reach this objective andbuild consumer-based brand equity. The selection of the cause is,therefore, extremely important when designing these initiatives."
e29,149,357,6,4353,5045,40,7,130,GulliverBL,7,Limitations and further research
e29,150,358,6,4353,5066,40,39,251,GulliverRM,7,"As with all research, this study is subject to several limita-tions. First, a convenience sample was used. Future research shouldbe conducted using different groups of consumers to general-ize the results of this study to other populations. Second, the"
e29,151,359,6,4353,4418,309,28,251,GulliverRM,7,"products, brands and causes used as stimuli in the experiment couldhave impacted the research ﬁndings. We recommend that furtherresearch consider other product categories, brands and causes."
e29,152,360,6,4353,4449,309,60,251,GulliverRM,7,"Our results also suggest that the interaction effect between ﬁtand product type is not signiﬁcant on credibility, attitude and pur-chase intention. However, although this was not the objective ofthis research, we believe that further analysis in the interactioneffects would be of interest and it represents one of our proposalsfor future research."
e29,153,361,6,4353,4512,309,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"Finally, this study has focused on the role of product typeand perceived ﬁt. More speciﬁcally, the core objective has beenfunctional ﬁt (product category) rather than brand ﬁt (image). Aspotential differences may arise when functional and brand ﬁtsare analyses, studies where simultaneous analyses are performedwould be of great interest. We also advocate future research to ana-lyze additional factors, such as variables related to the cause, thenon-proﬁt organization or the consumer characteristics, in orderto gain a better understanding of consumers’ responses to CRMinitiatives."
e29,154,362,6,4353,4616,309,39,251,GulliverRM,7,"Nevertheless, this study offers some new insights and adds tothe literature on consumer responses to CRM. Further, it is hopedthat the ﬁndings presented in this research will help managers toimprove the effectiveness of this practice."

The combination of fractional factorial design and Desirability functionwas used to evaluate the ICP OES operational parameters and the regression models using CentralComposite and Doehlert designs were calculated to stablish the best working condition for all analytes.Seventeen lipstick samples manufactured in different countries with different colors and brands wereanalyzed. Some samples contained high concentrations of toxic elements, such as Cr and Pb, which arecarcinogenic and cause allergic and eczematous dermatitis. The maximum concentration detected washigher than the permissible safe limits for human use, and the samples containing these high metalconcentrations were intended for use by children. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as achemometrics tool for exploratory analysis to observe the similarities between samples relative to themetal concentrations (a correlation between Cd and Pb was observed)."

This strategy has been studied with success to ana-lyze compounds of difﬁcult separation, but has not been explored for carbohydrates. Six procedures forthe analysis of different sets of CHOs present in six food matrices were developed. The effects of pH,electrolyte and surfactant concentrations on the separation of the compounds were investigated usinga central composite design requiring 17 experiments. The simultaneous optimization of the responsesfor separation of six sets of CHOs was performed employing empirical models for prediction of optimalresolution conditions in six matrices, condensed milk, orange juices, rice bran, red wine, roasted andground coffee and breakfast cereal samples. The results indicate good separation for the samples, withappropriate detectability and selectivity, short analysis time, low reagent cost and little waste generation,demonstrating that the proposed technique is a viable alternative for carbohydrate analysis in foods."

e32,17,35,1,50,517,51,206,251,GulliverRM,7,"The analysis of carbohydrates in foods has extreme nutritionalimportance since they contribute with 40–50% of the caloric intakeof human beings [1]. The constant increase in obesity indices, dia-betes and some CHO intolerances intensify the necessity of theirrigorous control. In the food industry, they are used as technolog-ical coadjuvants in order to obtain physicochemical and sensorialcharacteristics of foods [2,3], but they also serve as quality markersduring processing [4]. Milk, when subjected to excessive heating,suffers a lactose isomerization reaction forming lactulose and epi-lactose. Both have ssmaller biological values than lactose and maycause negative effects like ﬂatulence [4–7]. The presence of anexcessive amount of glucose in ground coffee after hydrolysis indi-cates product adulteration from the addition of other grains [8]. Inrice bran, a food industry by-product, xylose is the predominantcarbohydrate, which has been used as a source for obtaining xyl-itol (a compound with high sweetening power) [9]. In wines, thequantiﬁcation of CHOs is correlated with ﬁnal product conserva-tion. Studies indicate that the majority of microorganisms used forthe fermentation process consume more glucose than fructose. So,high contents of fructose in wine can compromise its preservation"

e32,23,45,1,50,517,320,259,251,GulliverRM,7,"The determination of different CHOs is a signiﬁcant challenge,since they are analytes of difﬁcult separation and present similarphysicochemical characteristics [12,13]. Several analytical tech-niques have been studied for this purpose, among them highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary elec-trophoresis (CE). CE is an ascending technique for this type ofanalysis, since the fused-silica capillary withstands highly alkalinepHs, above 11.5, allowing the ionization of CHOs, which facilitatesseparation [14–21]. Besides this, the technique has been largelyemployed owing to its low reagent consumption and waste gen-eration [14,22–26]. Various kinds of separations have already beenstudied with CE, emphasizing capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE),with or without derivatization reactions, and micellar electroki-netic chromatography (MEKC) with cationic surfactant [14–21].Despite several investigations developed to separate CHOs in foodmatrices, one can still verify some separations difﬁculties still exist,mainly between maltose and glucose [14], glucose and galactose[22], galactose, maltose and maltotriose [23], fructose and xylose[24] and fructose and mannose [8], separations that are very impor-tant for the food industry. The MEKC with anionic surfactant is atype of separation employed in several food analyses and is basedon analyte partition into two phases, the micellar phase and the runelectrolyte. The formation of micelles occurs by the addition of sur-factant agents to the electrolyte, in concentrations above the criticalmicellar concentration [27]. Bao et al. [28] observed good results"

e32,27,50,2,910,1006,40,227,251,GulliverRM,7,"In general, method optimization depends on several variables,which directly effect compound separation such as pH, the typeand concentration of electrolytes and surfactants, voltage, capil-lary length and temperature [8,14–18]. Multivariate optimizationstrategies have been increasingly and efﬁciently used for devel-oping and optimizing separation methods, since they allow theevaluation of interaction effects among the variables, reduce thenumber of experiments and make possible the construction ofempirical models to predict the most adequate experimental condi-tions [20,29]. On the other hand, optimization of the simultaneousseparation of several compounds involves a large number ofresponses, each of which may have different optimal regions withinthe experimental domain. The Derringer and Suich method [30],which is suitable for optimizing several responses, is based onthe construction of a global desirability function involving all theresponses of the system. Recently the central composite design [31]and the Derringer and Suich method have been successfully utilizedin several works like the studies of the separation of resveratrol innutraceuticals [32], rizatriptan in medical drugs [33], separation ofchiral compounds [34], optimization of biochemical experiments[35] and separation of phenolic compounds from extra-virgin oliveoil [36]."
e32,28,51,2,910,1236,40,112,251,GulliverRM,7,"In this study the MEKC technique with anionic surfactantwas investigated exploring its potential to separate carbohydrateswhich are difﬁcult to analyze owing to their structural similarities.To reduce the number of experiments to a minimum, this studywas made using a central composite design to evaluate the effectof three important variables, pH, electrolyte and surfactant con-centrations on separation. With the Derringer and Suich method,empirical predictions for the separation of the most important ana-lytes in each sample were determined. Six procedures applied to theseparation of CHOs in coffee, rice bran, red wine, breakfast cereal,orange juice and condensed milk were optimized and developed."

e32,793,1357,3,1771,2264,320,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"Experimental resolution results for the factors and levels stud-ied are shown in Table 1. All three investigated factors signiﬁcantlyaffected peak separations. In all the experiments the analytes pre-senteda, SAC, LAC, LTU, EPI, MTO, MAL, GAL, GLU, ARA, MAN, FRU,XYL, XYL and RIB elution order. The effects of pH increase werepositive for the resolutions of the majority of peak pairs, except forthe ARA-FRU, ARA-MAN and XYL-RIB pairs, where negative effectswere observed, indicating that the increase in the pH values, forlevels higher than those of the experimental domain studied, leadsto an inversion in their migration order."
e32,794,1358,3,1771,2369,320,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"The addition of SDS to the electrolyte led to a positive effectfor the majority of the resolutions studied, except for the onebetween ARA-MAN where this addition decreased separation. Thesigniﬁcant effect of SDS on the separation may be related tothe association of the solutes with the micelle surface, throughdipole–dipole or ion–dipole (or ionic) interactions at the surfactanthead. Strong coulomb interactions (attractive and repulsive) canalso occur when the solute is charged, as described by Tavares [40].The increase of sorbic acid concentration also resulted in positiveeffects on resolution."
e32,795,1359,3,1771,2474,320,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"It is possible to observe that the simultaneous increase of thethree factors contributed positively to an increase in the resolu-tions for the majority of the compounds.

To avoid these side effects theDerringer–Suich optimization criteria were modiﬁed to obtain ade-quate separation for the matrix, combined with the shortest runtime and the best signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, experimental con-ditions were chosen so that minimum NaOH (pH), surfactant andelectrolyte concentrations were used while maintaining an ade-quate resolution."

It was not possible to evaluate the ﬁtof the models for the resolutions between the compounds EPI-MTOand MAL-GAL, since a complete coelution occurred for all threereplicates at the central point. Thus, given the difﬁculty of mak-ing accurate estimates, resolution was considered to be zero for allthree tests, so that experimental error could not be estimated. As forregression signiﬁcance, the p values were all below 0.05, indicatingthat factor changes signiﬁcantly affect resolution. For the MAL-GAL"

The constantmodel indicates resolutions withrandom ﬂuctuations around 2.47. Using the Derringer and Suichdesirability method, the models were used to calculate predictionsof the optimized separation conditions for the pairs of carbohy-drates present in each of the six matrices. Table 3 shows the criteriaestablished for the models, their coded optimal experimental vari-ables, the corresponding predicted resolution responses and theresponses observed from the experimental tests under these con-ditions."
e32,920,1534,4,2632,3265,309,112,251,GulliverRM,7,"It is worth mentioning that for factor levels inside theexperimental domain optimum CHO separations were found forcondensed milk, wine, coffee, cereal and rice bran matrices. As forthe method applied to the separation of CHOs in fruit juice, whosecompounds of interest showed excellent separation in all tests, anextrapolation of all factor levels was possible, in an attempt to fur-ther reduce run time. Considering that increases in factor levelsfor this matrix cause increases in run time as well as reductions inanalytical signal for all the desirable conditions, Derringer–Suichcriteria for minimizing factor concentrations, while maintainingresolutions higher than 2 were imposed."

Initially theeffect of increasing the total capillary length to 112 cm was tested,which did not improve separation. In this situation, investigationswere conducted towards reduction of the bandwidth of the lac-tose peak. In the investigations carried out by Li et al.

e32,1001,1704,7,5214,5299,320,248,251,GulliverRM,7,"The using of the MEKC technique with anionic surfactant, com-bined with multivariate modeling to study the effects of pH,electrolyte and surfactant concentrations on peak pair resolutions,followed by Derringer and Suich desirability optimization wasefﬁciently used for the development of six different analytical pro-cedures applicable to the quantiﬁcation of CHOs in foods. Themultivariate optimization methods have providedmuch informa-tion about factor effects permitting empirical predictions of peakresolutions, performing only 17 experiments. After slight adjust-ments it was possible to obtain excellent results in real samples.The methods were successfully applied to the separation of CHOsin condensed milk (lactose, lactulose, epilactose, galactose andglucose), rice bran (glucose, arabinose, xylose and fructose), redwine (saccharose, galactose, glucose, arabinose, fructose, xyloseand ribose), roasted and ground coffee (galactose, glucose, arabi-nose, mannose, fructose, xylose and ribose), orange juice (sucrose,glucose and fructose) and even breakfast cereals (saccharose, lac-tose, lactulose, epilactose, maltotriose, maltose, galactose, glucoseand fructose). The methods presented good compound separationsand were cost-effective due to their fast analytical runs, use of sim-ple and accessible electrolytes and reduced volumes of generatedwaste, demonstrating that micellar electrokinetic chromatographyusing anionic surfactant is a viable alternative for carbohydrateanalysis in foods."

In 2012 the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) wasapproved and will be led by several United Nations Agencies, to strengthen and coordinateexisting initiatives and develop new infrastructure where needed to meet society’sclimate-related challenges. At European level the European Commission has allocatedalmost 27 million Euros from 2012 to 2016 towards the science behind seasonal anddecadal climate services effectively putting Europe at the forefront of the internationaleffort in developing this ﬁeld."
e33,14,33,1,50,438,195,74,307,AdvGulliv-R,7,One of the main challenges climate service will face is the bridging of the so called valleyof death: the divide still existing between climate science and decision-makers. Managingthe multiple boundaries between producers and users of climate information is now ofcrucial importance. The concept of codesign and more generally of co-generation of knowl-edge is key to success of the new generation of climate services which need to be perceivedas being not only credible scientiﬁcally but also salient and legitimate. In order to improveon the current setup it is essential for researchers to work on topics which could directlyimpact on the decision making process.

e33,23,50,2,842,896,41,28,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Building upon such international efforts, there are major research projects underway to improve the underpinning cli-mate science, promote the development of new applications and actively engage with users of climate services. Here wepresent some of the key challenges and open questions climate service science will face in the coming years."
e33,24,51,2,842,928,41,81,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Improved scientiﬁc knowledge of the processes controlling climate predictability has the potential to improve climate-inﬂuenced decisions. Whilst it is essential to improve our understanding of the climate and its impact on our activities, thiscannot occur in isolation and should instead ensure that users and producers of climate information effectively worktogether. Bridging the so-called ‘valley of death’ between users and providers is recognised as a key priority for climate ser-vices but currently there is limited understanding on how this should be done (Cash et al., 2006). Empirical research hasshown that a range of contextual and intrinsic factors affect the use of information in decision making, e.g., informal andformal institutional barriers, decision and policy goals, spatial and temporal resolution, quality-level required to utilisethe information and the level of trust between information producers and users."
e33,25,52,2,842,1012,41,39,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"One challenge is that climate scientists are often motivated by curiosity and a desire for a deeper understanding of theprocesses controlling weather and climate and their variability, whilst the majority of decision makers require the minimumamount of, or easiest to obtain, knowledge to sufﬁciently inform their decisions. This motivational divide can create a dis-connection between real and perceived needs of decision makers."
e33,26,53,2,842,1053,41,39,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Working on the interactions between providers and users of climate information is thus of crucial importance. Identifyingeffective ways to co-design and co-generate climate services with the users is becoming one of the most important chal-lenges that climate service science needs to tackle (Lemos and Morehouse, 2005; McNie, 2008). The co-design process isneeded to develop knowledge that is scientiﬁcally credible, trustworthy, relevant and actionable (Cash et al., 2003)."
e33,27,54,2,842,1095,41,70,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"The current situation can be improved by researchers prioritising work on topics which directly impact on decision-making processes; for example focusing research effort on the parameters, timescales, and spatial scales that are mostrelevant to users. Rather than undermining the need for fundamental research, this shift in priority should be seen as anattempt to focus some of the international research effort on user-relevant science (Stokes, 1997). This can in turn help mak-ing some essential observational and modelling activities more visible and attractive to a wider community. In order to beeffective in addressing speciﬁc problems the development of scientiﬁc knowledge needs to become more ﬂexible, iterativeand interactive (Kirchhoff et al., 2013)."
e33,28,55,2,842,1168,41,102,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"There are a number of challenges climate science is facing in the generation of reliable and skilful predictions on decision-relevant time horizons. Climate simulations try to represent the future, and past, evolution of the climate system over time-scales that range from a few weeks, through seasons, years, decades and centuries. For many climate-inﬂuenced decisions,prediction times of months to a decade are likely to be the most important. Making predictions with such lead times largelyrelies on the existence of relatively slow, and hence predictable, variations in quantities such as the moisture in the soil,snow cover, sea-ice and ocean temperatures (Shukla and Kinter, 2006), and how the atmosphere interacts with and isaffected by these conditions. In addition, the observed evolution of temperature and other climate variables at the seasonaland longer timescales can also be considered as externally forced low-frequency variability due to human-induced changesin greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol concentrations, land-use changes as well as natural variations in solar activity and vol-canic eruptions, superimposed on the natural variability of the system."
e33,29,56,2,842,1273,41,81,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"At seasonal timescales, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO; Chang et al., 2006) is the main process that contributes tothe forecast quality on seasonal timescales (van Oldenborgh et al., 2005) and its understanding and modelling has been themain target of the scientiﬁc community. Efforts to formulate forecasts at the sub-seasonal timescale have only recentlybegun with the development of a Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) prediction metric and a common approach to its appli-cation amongst a number of international forecast centres (e.g., Gottschalck et al., 2010) and operational dynamical forecast"

e33,29,59,2,842,1273,41,81,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,aims to create a multi-model operational system for climate prediction at those timescales.
e33,30,60,2,842,1357,41,39,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Timescales beyond a few months have also been considered in dynamical predictions (e.g., Smith et al., 2007;Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013a). These efforts bridge the timescales between seasonal and multi-decadal forecasting problems,and show that other modes of variability, particularly in the North Atlantic, have skill with respect to simple benchmarksbeyond the ﬁrst forecast year."
e33,31,61,2,842,1399,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Two types of prediction methods are typically used, those based on either statistical-empirical approaches or on process-based dynamical systems. Scientists developing each method might feel tempted to compete to demonstrate which one isbest, but both types are complementary because advances in statistical prediction are often associated with enhanced under-standing, which usually leads to improved dynamical prediction, and vice versa (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013b; Kirtman et al.,2013). This collaborative approach should be favoured for the users’ beneﬁt."
e33,32,62,2,842,1451,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Due to the chaotic nature of the climate system and the inadequacy of current forecast systems, quantifying forecast"
e33,32,63,2,842,1451,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"uncertainty plays an important role in climate forecasting (Palmer, 2000). This is because a priori estimates of the uncer-tainty can be used as predictors of the forecast error, a fundamental element of a forecast when making informed decisions.Two of the main sources of uncertainty in dynamical climate prediction are the lack of perfect knowledge of the initial con-ditions of the climate system and the inability to perfectly model this system (Slingo and Palmer, 2011)."

e33,56,91,3,1635,1884,36,39,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"The unavoidable uncertainty in climate prediction forces climate forecasts to be formulated in a probabilistic way(Tippett and Barnston, 2008). Besides the different aspects associated with forecast accuracy the probabilistic formulationrequires an appropriate assessment of how reliable (i.e., whether the forecast uncertainty estimate is accurate) the forecastsare (Slingo and Palmer, 2011), a concept absolutely fundamental for an appropriate use of the climate information."
e33,57,92,3,1635,1926,36,112,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Global forecast systems are often unable to provide information at the spatial scale required for (or perceived to beneeded by) many end users. Although there are both empirical and dynamical approaches to downscaling, local-scale sea-sonal predictions focus on the empirical/statistical methods due to the enormous amount of re-forecasts that have to bedownscaled to estimate both the model systematic error and the necessary forecast quality (Frías et al., 2010). The meritsof empirical/statistical downscaling consist mainly in providing climate information for speciﬁc locations and with muchreduced systematic error (Charles et al., 2013), but with a marginal increase, when not a degradation, of the skill. Whilstdynamical downscaling climate predictions could be justiﬁable given the importance of local feedbacks between, for exam-ple, soil moisture, clouds and precipitation, until now, no clear advantages in terms of forecast quality of dynamically down-scaled predictions have been found (Diro et al., 2012). Hence, users need to be made aware that at the moment increasing thespatial resolution of the climate predictions they are interested in might provide no beneﬁt and it could even degrade thequality of the information with respect to what is found for larger spatial scales."
e33,58,93,3,1635,2041,36,70,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"Apart from the regionalisation to increase the spatial resolution of the predictions, a post-processing method known ascalibration is needed to prevent climate information suffering from unavoidable systematic errors present in all forecast sys-tems. In addition, as different sources of information are available, such as different dynamical forecast systems (as in themulti-model approach), several complementary statistical predictions (Hawkins et al., 2011) and climatology estimates,robust combination methods are needed. Both calibration and combination have been explored in research and operationalseasonal prediction but still require a substantial amount of attention to adapt the methods to the requirements expressedby the users."

e33,62,99,3,1635,2167,36,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"These challenges are already being tackled but if we want to maximise the societal impact of climate knowledge it isessential we illustrate to policy-makers, stakeholders and the public the usefulness and relevance of these improvements.We need to greatly improve the interface between the scientiﬁc understanding of the predictions and the decision-makingprocesses. The need for such a translation from science to users has long been identiﬁed as a critical priority. The same, per-haps, cannot be said for the opposite and very few have yet recognised the importance of formally mapping the societal needinto the research agenda."
e33,63,100,3,1635,2229,36,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"The climate community is just beginning to realise that research projects should not engage with stakeholders at the endof the project in an attempt to ‘sell’ the newly acquired knowledge. Instead, key to the development of successful climateservices is the co-design which implies a continuous interaction between users and producers throughout the life of the pro-ject.

Thisallowed the project to inform the research agenda and focus more attention on the phenomena that matter in controlling themonsoon onset which, in turn, led to an improvement in the relevant model performance."
e33,68,110,4,2428,2513,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"The interaction with the users can also lead to unexpected results. Working on malaria outbreak in Botswana, Thomsonet al. (2006) found that the third rather than the top rainfall quartile category was the one showing the highest skill. Thiscame as a surprise because the inner categories do not usually receive as much attention as the outer categories. Exposingthe users of climate information to the limits of our climate understanding is probably as important as it is for the researchcommunity to understand what the most relevant challenges are for the decision-makers."
e33,69,111,4,2428,2565,41,28,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"The interaction between providers and users can be daunting at ﬁrst. Often users’ requirements are perceived asunachievable by the scientists whilst the available products are often considered sub-optimal by the users. Whilst thismay sound challenging, it actually provides a good starting point for the necessary dialogue between both parties."
e33,70,112,4,2428,2597,41,49,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"It has recently been re-emphasised (Weaver et al., 2013) that focusing on the two-way communication process is a betterapproach of interaction between producers and users of climate information than a one-way model. Researchers developingclimate services should put sufﬁcient effort into actively improving their interface with decision makers. Unfortunately thistypically requires a detailed understanding of users needs and the decision-making process, something that is not commonlyfound amongst scientists."
e33,71,113,4,2428,2649,41,28,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"EUPORIAS (http://www.euporias.eu), an EC-funded project on climate services science, addresses this through the inclu-sion in the project consortium of several social scientists, design specialists, communicators and artists. This led to the devel-opment of a protocol of interaction between the project and the stakeholders early on."
e33,72,114,4,2428,2681,41,60,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"To address some of these aspects, the EUPORIAS project is being developed around the needs and involvement of stake-holders from a variety of climate-sensitive sectors, and it is being shaped to embrace the concept of co-design. The stake-holders have been closely involved since before the project started and play a pivotal role throughout in deﬁning theresearch priorities and in selecting case studies for more detailed study. The main outcome of the project will be the deliveryof a few semi-operational prototypes working on the seasonal (and possibly inter-annual) timescale drawing on the casestudies."
e33,73,115,4,2428,2743,41,91,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"A post-normal science approach (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 2003) to the co-production of actionable knowledge is likely tobecome an integral part of climate service science. At this stage the standard paradigm is still largely based on the translationof science output onto the impact user-relevant space. Whilst such a solution can potentially make the information moreusable and actionable the full potential of the available climate knowledge cannot be obtained without a signiﬁcant para-digm shift. An important example is conﬁdence in climate predictions. Climate science strives to identify the boundariesof knowledge. These boundaries can reside, for instance, around forecast uncertainty, which lies in the climate model formu-lation, the initial conditions or other forms of uncertainty. The providers of climate information typically offer a mapping ofthis uncertainty onto the impacts with minimal understanding of how this information has fed into the decision-makingchain. This clearly results in a sub-optimal sampling of forecast uncertainty from a user point of view."
e33,74,116,4,2428,2837,41,81,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"We argue that much more should be done to map speciﬁc decisions onto our knowledge (or lack thereof) of the futureclimate state. We have often tried to characterise our ignorance of the future state of the system through a number of tech-niques (such as empirical models, an ensemble of initial conditions, perturbed physics ensemble, etc). With a few noticeableexceptions such as representative concentration pathways of atmospheric composition (Meinshausen et al., 2011), theseapproaches start from the climate scientist’s knowledge and map it into a decision-relevant space. To some decision makersthe only part of the prediction space that matters is the one that maps in the surroundings of a speciﬁc decision threshold(Thomson et al., 2006). Effort should be put into inverting the relationship linking climate information to climate-sensitive"
e33,74,117,4,2428,2837,41,81,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,decisions as this would help the user understand which part of our ignorance is more relevant to them.
e33,75,118,4,2428,2921,41,28,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,The fact that at present such an inverse mapping may prove difﬁcult or unfeasible should not prevent us from trying.Many of the recent advancements in science would have been unconceivable only a few decades ago. We are proposing herethat gaining this sort of understanding would be very useful in informing the research agenda.
e33,76,119,4,2428,2953,41,39,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"The beneﬁt of such a paradigm shift would be twofold. Firstly, it could provide new visibility and relevance to speciﬁcareas of science which, despite their potential relevance for the decision-maker, have not managed to attract sufﬁcient atten-tion and funding. Secondly, such an approach could lead to the identiﬁcation of a new class of scientiﬁc challenges that mayhave been overlooked by scientists.The key challenges climate services face can be summarised as follows:"
e33,77,120,4,2428,3005,53,7,453,AdvGulliv-R,7,1- Develop and promote novel dialogue mechanisms and fora to ensure users and providers of climate information work
e33,78,121,4,2428,3015,65,7,175,AdvGulliv-R,7,together and co-design actionable knowledge.
e33,79,122,4,2428,3026,53,7,453,AdvGulliv-R,7,"2- Promote a non-hierarchical, heterogeneously organised multidisciplinary approach to service-development which"
e33,80,123,4,2428,3036,65,7,279,AdvGulliv-R,7,should build upon the knowledge and skill sets of different communities.
e33,81,124,4,2428,3047,53,7,453,AdvGulliv-R,7,3- Give visibility amongst users to the needs for a signiﬁcant investment in the science that underpins climate services.
e33,82,125,4,2428,3068,41,28,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,"These big challenges are unlikely to be tackled by one single project. International research efforts are starting to show anappetite for user-driven initiatives, which in time should enable the provision of guidance of how climate service projectsshould be structured and run."
e33,83,126,4,2428,3099,41,18,466,AdvGulliv-R,7,The SPECS–EUPORIAS experience is likely to represent only one of the many attempts that will be needed to understandhow to best structure the interaction between users and providers of climate information so that the societal beneﬁt can be

We encourage both the climate community as awhole and the funding agencies to be brave in exploring novel user–provider interactions.

e34,10,25,1,50,422,181,140,360,TrebuchetMS,8,"We outline commonly noticed shortcomings and ways to overcome them in the manu-scripts submitted by new management researchers, such as doctoral students and junior faculty.The usual pitfalls in manuscripts submitted to business and management journals include poorwriting and presentation, lack of integration, lack of signiﬁcance, poor research design, and scantydescription of methods, untidy presentation of results, and inadequate and sloppy discussion andimplication sections. Borrowing from our experiences and the writings of the editors of top tiermanagement journals, we offer guidelines for crafting clear and persuasive manuscripts. We providesuggestions for developing each section of the manuscript: topic choice, abstract, introduc-tion, theory and grounding of hypotheses, research design, methods and results, discussion andimplications, and references.© 2017 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Indian Institute of ManagementBangalore.

e34,25,48,2,893,1243,53,9,140,TrebuchetMS-Bold,9,Basic writing and presentation
e34,26,49,2,893,1267,53,195,238,TrebuchetMS,8,"Daft (1995) suggests that three skills are needed to be a topprofessional in the organisational sciences—theory skills,writing skills, and design skills. Despite the importance ofwriting skills, they do not seem to receive sufﬁcient atten-tion from management researchers, and poor writing and pre-sentation remains one of the most prevalent problems inmanuscripts submitted to management journals (Bettis &Penberra, 1989; Billsberry, 2014; Daft, 1995; Fischer, 1992;Thompson, 1981). The manuscript may be addressing an in-teresting idea but the basic writing problem is too distract-ing to allow the reviewers to focus on the content of themanuscript. Bettis and Penberra (1989) observe that poorwriting often is more a matter of haste and carelessnessby the author than a lack of writing expertise, and a poormanuscript is often the result of premature submission. A"

Doing so increases the work of journaleditors and reviewers and adds to their frustration. It maynot serve the authors in that the comments they receive fromeditors and reviewers may not be all that pleasant and con-"

e34,42,70,2,893,1212,311,107,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"the reasons this can happen is because the authors are tryingto do too much in a single manuscript. Reviewers ﬁnd suchmanuscripts quite annoying to go through. Rather than of-fering their comments on the content of the manuscript, theirattention gets shifted to issues of writing and formatting. Asauthors, we always have a lot of interesting things to say ina paper, but we must resist the urge to incorporate all ofthem, many of which may only be tangentially relevant. Itrequires much discipline to stay focussed on the main argu-ment and not digress into less important ones."
e34,43,71,2,893,1321,311,151,238,TrebuchetMS,8,"Close to half of the submissions to management journalsso miss the mark that they cannot even be sent out forreview (Billsberry, 2014). Manuscripts with many typographi-cal and grammatical errors, convey to the editors andreviewers the impression that the authors did not takethe writing of their manuscript earnestly. On occasions,manuscripts do not even include page numbers. We alsoﬁnd instances of improper and inconsistent use of fonts andformat in the manuscript. In the process of cutting andpasting, we ﬁnd manuscripts using more than one font in"
e34,43,72,2,893,1321,311,151,238,TrebuchetMS,8,"the same paragraph. Journals provide details on fonts andformats to be used in a manuscript. Most journals requirethat the manuscripts be double-spaced, but we often en-counter manuscripts that are single-spaced."
e34,44,73,2,893,1475,311,96,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"In recent years, we have begun seeing a common problemof too many abbreviations being used. Abbreviating may benecessary if there is a long term that is used many times inthe manuscript. Using the full term throughout makes it anawkward read. In such a case an abbreviated term is pre-ferred. If a term is used only once, the use of an abbrevia-tion serves no purpose. The use of abbreviations in the title"

Similarly, we frequently observe that theconstructs/variables are sometimes capitalised and at othertimes they are not. Two things are key in this respect. First,the guidelines of the journal to which the manuscript is sub-mitted should dictate what to do. Second, if the journal guide-lines are not clear whether to capitalise or not to capitaliseheadings/subheadings and constructs/variables, the authorsneed to make a decision on what they want to do and thendo it uniformly."
e34,49,81,3,1737,1902,45,96,238,TrebuchetMS,8,"References connect a scholar’s work to the related lit-erature. Improper citation of sources and missing sources candistract the reader from the substance of the manuscript. Thereferences should be accurate, with the author’s name spelledcorrectly and the listed year accurate. Journals usually havetheir own style of referencing. The use of a referencing styleof a different journal may suggest that the manuscript hasbeen rejected by that journal or that the author has poor at-tention to detail (Colquitt, 2013)."
e34,50,82,3,1737,2001,45,140,238,TrebuchetMS,8,Many manuscripts are rejected because they do not follow
e34,50,83,3,1737,2001,45,140,238,TrebuchetMS,8,"the “house style”, the speciﬁc style of a journal for present-ing the content (George, 2012). The house style is reﬂectedin the structure of the presentation—how certain sections suchas theoretical background, hypotheses, methods, results, anddiscussion are explicated. The proper format and presenta-tion of ﬁgures and tables in a manuscript is an importantcomponent of the house style of a journal. Manuscripts withcarelessly done ﬁgures and tables are not uncommon. Thetitles of ﬁgures and tables should be precise and should followthe journal’s style. It may be a good idea to look at recentlypublished papers in a journal to get a clear sense of the formatof ﬁgures and tables."

The reader is presented with concepts, jargon, and ac-ronyms that are not deﬁned or are used inconsistently in themanuscript. One of the reasons this may happen is becausethe authors are too close to the material and fail to put them-selves in the shoes of the reader (Ragins, 2012); the authorsget too wrapped up in their ideas and lose their perspectiveof what is primarily important and what is less important forthe purpose of the manuscript."
e34,53,89,3,1737,1905,302,9,159,TrebuchetMS-Bold,9,Lack of signiﬁcance and originality
e34,54,90,3,1737,1929,302,173,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"Fischer (1992) notes that lack of signiﬁcance is a major short-coming in manuscripts submitted to business and manage-ment journals. Lack of signiﬁcance occurs in three ways:(a) failure to go beyond existing literature; (b) unimportanttopic; and (c) trivial ﬁndings. We ﬁnd three typical but relatedproblems in the manuscripts of management researchersfrom emerging economies regarding signiﬁcance and origi-nality. First, many of the manuscripts address theories and"
e34,54,91,3,1737,1929,302,173,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"models from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The citations andreferences of the manuscript are old and outdated. While theclassic research studies from the earlier decades need to beincluded in the manuscript, the less important studies neednot because including all the studies makes the reference listtoo long and it also shows that the authors probably do notknow which studies are seminal and which are not (Colquitt,2013)."
e34,55,92,3,1737,2104,302,206,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"The second problem, which may overlap with the ﬁrst one,is picking overly researched topics such as the leader-member exchange theory and organisational citizenshipbehaviours. The case for such mature and over-studied topicsis much harder to make than topics that are new, fresh, andpoorly understood. The overly researched topics fail to gen-erate any interest and enthusiasm in the reviewers and editors.The third common problem is that the manuscripts of man-agement researchers from emerging economies justify thecontribution of the study by simply arguing that there arenot many studies on the topic in their country. The review-ers may not ﬁnd such an argument compelling. The authorsneed to explain why the relationships observed in previousstudies elsewhere may or may not hold in their countrycontext. The authors need to provide a theory of the con-"

Whateverthe reason, lack of clear and full description of methods leavesreviewers confused. They would want to know if the mea-sures used in the study capture the proposed constructs. Theauthors need to include their measures, whether newly de-veloped or existing ones, in tables or exhibits so that thereviewers can readily look at them and see if they make sense.The authors are obligated to provide clear and sufﬁcient de-scriptions of validities and reliabilities of the measures usedin the study."

A carefully con-sidered outline of the manuscript may be a good starting pointbefore plunging headlong into the writing of the manu-script. The outline may include ordering of key arguments ineach section of the paper and how they connect with eachother. The judicious use of headings and subheadings canenhance the readability of the manuscript signiﬁcantly.

e34,67,112,4,2581,3041,53,162,239,TrebuchetMS,8,A common problem related to the discussion section of thepaper is that the authors confound results and discussion sec-tions with each other. The results section is simply a report-ing of the results of the data analyses. It also provides speciﬁcinformation on hypotheses that received support and the onesthat did not. The scope of the results section does not includea detailed explanation of why certain hypotheses were sup-

It is the discussion section thatneeds to explain the ﬁndings of the study in relation to theunderlying theory and previous research. The repetition ofresults in the discussion section needs to be avoided. The dis-cussion section should talk about the main thesis and whatthe study contributes to existing knowledge. This section needsto then describe what it means to future research and man-agement practice.

Colquitt and George (2011) suggest thatthe chosen topic should tackle a signiﬁcant issue, pursue anovel direction that arouses and maintains curiosity, buildsa study with ambitious scope, and uncovers actionable in-sights. Naturally, the question arises as to how to select a goodtopic? Doctoral students and junior faculty struggle with thisissue more than the experienced scholars. We would liketo make some suggestions based on our experiences. First,you may want to talk to trusted colleagues and experiencedscholars about the research idea that you are toying with.Their feedback will offer clues on whether the topic is worthpursuing. Second, if the topic clears this ﬁrst test, the nextstep is doing preliminary research on the topic and giving aresearch seminar to departmental colleagues. You can gaugethe merit of the topic from the comments of the seminar par-ticipants. The topic is worth pursuing further if it arouses muchinterest in the participants and awakens their curiosity as re-searchers. The third suggestion is to submit a conceptual paperto a research conference. The comments of the conferencereviewers are likely to be a good barometer of the worth ofthe topic."

e34,76,132,4,2581,3283,311,30,239,TrebuchetMS,8,A good introduction captures the attention of the reviewersand makes a favourable ﬁrst impression. If the reviewers are

e34,81,138,5,3424,3545,61,8,191,TrebuchetMS,8,teresting and important in theory and practice?
e34,82,139,5,3424,3556,45,41,238,TrebuchetMS,8,"(2) What key theoretical perspectives and empirical ﬁnd-ings have already informed the topic or question? Whatmajor, unaddressed issues does this study address and whydo they need to be addressed?"

e34,85,142,5,3424,3633,45,107,238,TrebuchetMS,8,Grant and Pollock (2011) noted three common mistakesmade in introductions. The most common of them is provid-ing insufﬁcient justiﬁcation for the importance of the topicand how the paper contributes to existing knowledge. Thesecond problem is the lack of focus. The introduction sectionmay be too long and contain extraneous arguments that do
e34,85,143,5,3424,3633,45,107,238,TrebuchetMS,8,not relate to the core research question. The third problemis “overpromising”. The authors set very high expectationsabout the study in the introduction section but then fail tomeet them in the rest of the paper.
e34,86,144,5,3424,3743,45,30,238,TrebuchetMS,8,"The introduction section requires a lot of attention fromauthors. To make it focussed and impactful, it may needseveral revisions."
e34,87,145,5,3424,3796,45,9,168,TrebuchetMS-Bold,9,Theory and grounding of hypotheses
e34,88,146,5,3424,3820,45,96,238,TrebuchetMS,8,"A lack of proper theoretical grounding is a common problemin manuscripts submitted to management journals. Daft (1995)reported that about half of the manuscripts had little or notheory. Without a theory, there is nothing to pull the studytogether. Simply reviewing the literature and showingthat each variable appeared previously is not enough. Thetheory provides an overarching, coherent framework forthe study, and thus the theory section is a critical part ofthe paper."
e34,89,147,5,3424,3918,45,74,239,TrebuchetMS,8,Sparrowe and Mayer (2011) have offered many excellentsuggestions on how to develop this section. They observethat the primary purpose of the theory section is to groundhypotheses. This can be achieved by positioning the study
e34,89,148,5,3424,3918,45,74,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"hypotheses in relation to the related research literature anddeveloping clear, logical arguments explaining why the keyvariables are related in the proposed manner."
e34,90,149,5,3424,3995,45,162,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"One commonly observed problem in the theory and ground-ing hypotheses section is that the authors do a basic literaturereview, which is consistent with the format of the tradi-tional doctoral theses. In a research paper, there is a deli-cate balance between engaging previous research and carefullydeveloping one’s own novel insights that ultimately lead tothe formulation of a theoretical model and hypotheses. It isimportant to cite relevant prior research, but the theory"
e34,90,150,5,3424,3995,45,162,239,TrebuchetMS,8,section should not be built around these prior works such that
e34,90,151,5,3424,3995,45,162,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"the logical reasoning is pushed to the background (Sparrowe& Mayer, 2011). At the same time, it is important to avoidthe other extreme, focussing exclusively on the argument andignoring prior related research. Failing to cite highly rel-evant studies leads readers to question the value of the"

e34,91,153,5,3424,3479,302,9,74,TrebuchetMS-Bold,9,Research design
e34,92,154,5,3424,3503,302,217,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"Research design, like topic choice, is a section that is not ame-nable to revision. Thus, it needs careful planning so as to avoidproblems and surprises later. A basic problem with the re-search design would cast a doubt on the study ﬁndings. Bonoand McNamara (2011) identify three broad research designproblems in manuscripts: (1) mismatch between research ques-tion and design; (2) mismatch between construct deﬁnitionand operationalisation; and (3) inappropriate or incompletemodel speciﬁcation. For example, researchers cannot developcausal attributions with cross-sectional data, nor can they es-tablish change, regardless of which analytical tools they use.Similarly, asking students with limited work experience toparticipate in experimental research in which they make ex-ecutive decisions may not be appropriate. Prior to makingoperational decisions, the authors developing a new con-struct must clearly articulate the deﬁnition and boundariesof the new construct, map its association with existing con-structs, and avoid assumptions that the scales with the same"

e34,94,157,5,3424,3765,302,96,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"The methods and results sections often play a major role inhow reviewers evaluate a manuscript. Instead of providinga clear and complete description of data collection proce-dures and ﬁndings, these sections often leave reviewersconfused. Many authors seem to hide the details of their re-search procedures, as if they fear that reviewers will criti-cise and reject the paper for those weaknesses (Daft, 1995).There is no better way to defuse criticism than to admit theweaknesses."
e34,95,158,5,3424,3863,302,63,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"The sections on methods and results answer two broadquestions: (1) how and why the data were obtained, and (2)how the data were analysed and what was found. Zhang andShaw (2012) found lack of completeness, clarity, and cred-ibility as the three main problems in the methods and resultssections that led to the rejection of manuscripts."

The methods should be described so fully thatsomeone could replicate the study and get the same results.Including an appendix with a full list of measures can behelpful to reviewers.

e34,97,163,5,3424,4028,302,85,238,TrebuchetMS,8,Authors far too often fail to clearly explain whatthey have done. Zhang and Shaw (2012) found not reportinghow measures were adapted as one common problem.Authors can avoid such a problem by using the full validatedmeasures of constructs when they are available. If that is
e34,97,164,5,3424,4028,302,85,238,TrebuchetMS,8,"not possible, it is necessary to provide a justiﬁcation for the"

e34,102,172,6,4268,4356,53,85,239,TrebuchetMS,8,The authors can enhance the credibility of theirstudy by explaining why a particular setting and sample werechosen. It is crucial to offer sufﬁcient evidence of reliabilitiesand validities of the measures used. The authors need to deﬁnethe key constructs clearly and demonstrate that the mea-sures they have used do capture those constructs.

The ﬁrst mistakethat authors make is to rehash the results. Authors devotetoo much discussion to summarising and re-summarising theresults of their hypothesis tests while devoting too little at-tention to explaining what the results mean. Instead, whatis needed in the discussion section is a thoughtful interpre-tation of why the ﬁndings are important and how they changethe conversation that the research joins."
e34,105,176,6,4268,4641,53,63,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"The second mistake authors make in their discussion sectionis to meander; that is, the section seems to lack focus aroundkey issues. A paper’s discussion of theoretical implicationsshould cohere around a small number of important issues thatare covered in great depth. The discussion section may go intotoo much detail in its contributions and implications."
e34,106,177,6,4268,4707,65,8,226,TrebuchetMS,8,A third mistake in the discussion section involves over-

e34,109,180,6,4268,4773,53,118,239,TrebuchetMS,8,Colquitt (2013) offers an excellent treatment of how tocraft references in research papers. The author divides hisdiscussion in two parts: avoiding shoddy craftsmanship
e34,109,181,6,4268,4773,53,118,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"and achieving reﬁned craftsmanship. The shoddy craftsman-ship in references can be avoided in two ways. First, thereferences need to be formatted according to the guide-lines of the journal to which the manuscript is being submit-ted. Second, it is important to be accurate bibliographicallyand that includes correct spelling of the author’s name, propervolume and page numbers of the source, and the correct yearof the publication."
e34,110,182,6,4268,4894,53,107,239,TrebuchetMS,8,Colquitt (2013) recommends four ways to achieve reﬁnedcraftsmanship in referencing. The ﬁrst suggestion is that theauthors be accurate substantively in the citing of their sources.
e34,110,183,6,4268,4894,53,107,239,TrebuchetMS,8,The second recommendation is to acknowledge seminality
e34,110,184,6,4268,4894,53,107,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"and to give credit where credit is truly due. The third sug-gestion is to account for the rigour of the studies. More robustand rigorous studies should be given more weight than otherstudies, thus ensuring that the most persuasive knowledgeis what gets transmitted through the literature. The last"
e34,110,185,6,4268,4894,53,107,239,TrebuchetMS,8,suggestion offered by Colquitt is to optimise the scope of
e34,111,186,6,4268,4323,311,52,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"references. On the one hand, omitting important refer-ences fails to give credit where credit is due. On the otherhand, too many references can distract readers while addingunnecessary length to a manuscript. Thus, the authors needto strike a balance."
e34,112,187,6,4268,4397,311,10,122,TrebuchetMS-Bold,10,Other broad suggestions
e34,113,188,6,4268,4422,311,118,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"When we were new to research, we were advised not to submita manuscript unless it was fully ready. We were also advisedto revise our work many times and seek feedback from col-leagues and senior scholars. On many occasions, we ignoredthis advice only to experience unfavourable and unpleasantoutcomes later. In the beginning of our career, we were de-fensive and did not take criticism of our manuscripts from col-leagues and reviewers too well, but doing so was not helpful.The sooner we learn to be open to feedback and become abit thick-skinned, the sooner we become more persuasive asscholars and writers."
e34,114,189,6,4268,4543,311,85,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"The business and management schools in emerging econo-mies like India have to step up the training and grinding inclear writing in their doctoral programs. Further, they needto inculcate a culture in which their experienced facultymentor doctoral students and new faculty in research projects.Another practical suggestion for authors is to enlist the ser-vices of a professional copy editor before submitting theirmanuscript for review and publication considerations."
e34,115,190,6,4268,4630,311,140,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"Publishing in top tier journals has become an increas-ingly hard and complex task. Doing so requires mastery intheory, methods, writing, and a bit of luck. It seems quite adifﬁcult proposition for an individual scholar to achievemastery in all the required areas. Thus, forming a researchteam with complementary skills may be the answer to thechallenge of publishing in top tier journals. For example, somescholars are good in theory and others in methods. A re-search team with a suitable combination of expertise in theoryand methods may improve the chances of developing a manu-script that does well in the review process. Moreover, as re-searchers, we learn and grow more quickly when working withother accomplished researchers."
e34,116,191,6,4268,4773,311,63,239,TrebuchetMS,8,"Finally, we agree with Daft’s (1995) observation that writingskills, like theory building skills, are hard to learn and theytake time, commitment, and hard work. “These skills may"

e35,85,156,3,1737,1887,51,111,239,AdvCAECI-R,7,Data presented in Table 1 showed that the mean age of uni-versity respondents was 41 years while that of respondentsin research institutes was 39 years. This implies that respon-dents in the universities were relatively older than respon-dents in the research institutes. Although staff from bothuniversities and research institutes was sufﬁciently youngand active age to face challenges associated with researchactivities. This ﬁnding is consistent with [21] who found thatuniversities staff were older than staff in non-universitybased agricultural research institutes in Nigeria.
e35,86,157,3,1737,2002,51,156,239,AdvCAECI-R,7,Table 1 also indicated that the mean years of research
e35,86,158,3,1737,2002,51,156,239,AdvCAECI-R,7,experience of universities respondents was 11 years whilethat of respondents in the research institutes was 9 years.This ﬁnding corroborates [15] who found in a similar studythat university staff respondents had longer years of experi-ence in research compared to their counterparts in researchinstitutes. Majority (66.2%) of the universities respondentshad a PhD as their highest qualiﬁcation while most of theresearch institutes respondents had BSc/BTech and MSc/MTech (34.9% and 38.8% respectively) as their highest qualiﬁ-[23]cation. Thiswho reported that universities in Nigeria have higher numberof qualiﬁed researchers than the agriculturalresearchinstitutes.

This ﬁnding is consistentwith [21] who reported that majority of university based sci-entists were male."

e35,129,223,4,2581,2827,47,237,239,AdvCAECI-R,7,Use of personal funds for technology generation took thelead among respondents in the universities as compared torespondents in the research institutes where this sourcewas less prominent. It can be inferred that the high percent-
e35,129,224,4,2581,2827,47,237,239,AdvCAECI-R,7,"age of universities respondents who utilized their personalfunds for research were working for their personal academicand intellectual advancement as their promotion criteriawere largely based on published research ﬁndings. The desireto meet the required number of published articles before thenext promotion is likely to be the driving force for using per-sonal funds. Uzuegbunam [31] also found that majority of theuniversities researchers used their personalfunds forresearch. This ﬁnding is in line with ﬁndings of [24] whoreported that the bulk of university researchers are drivenby demand for publication towards career advancement. Also,Bogoro [7] stated that the slogan in the universities now is‘‘Publish or Perish"

e35,129,226,4,2581,2827,47,237,239,AdvCAECI-R,7,rather than orientation of researchtowards technological development. Oloruntoba and Ajayi[22] further stressed that research publication in the universi-ties is a major signiﬁcantindicator of academic staffproductivity.
e35,130,227,4,2581,3068,47,111,239,AdvCAECI-R,7,Very few (1.5%) of the universities respondents receivedsupport from farmers. Earlier study by Agbamu [3] andMadukwe [16] reported similar weak ﬁnancial involvementin research with universities staff as compared to farmer’s
e35,130,228,4,2581,3068,47,111,239,AdvCAECI-R,7,participation with staff in research and advisory institutes

Similarﬁnding of failure to involve poor farmers was reported byAdugna [2] as challenges to improve research, extensionand education linkage in Ethiopia."
e35,131,230,4,2581,3182,47,145,239,AdvCAECI-R,7,Results illustrated in Table 2 further showed that otherstakeholders such as private sector and ﬁnancial institutionswhere respondents obtained loans participated in fundingagricultural research in universities and research institutes.This ﬁnding is in line with the opinion of Obayan [20] thatthe practice in some part of the world is basically the respon-

e35,254,442,6,4268,4822,47,7,210,AdvCAECI-R,7,Findings of this study suggest four main conclusions:
e35,255,443,6,4268,4846,48,7,237,AdvCAECI-R,7,1. There was little difference between institution types in the
e35,256,444,6,4268,4857,59,7,92,AdvCAECI-R,7,mean age of their staff.
e35,257,445,6,4268,4869,48,30,237,AdvCAECI-R,7,2. University staff were better qualiﬁed than their counter-parts in ARIs. The number of PhD holders in the universi-ties was greater than that of the research institutes.
e35,258,446,6,4268,4903,48,111,237,AdvCAECI-R,7,3. Use of personal funds to resource research was more com-mon among universities respondents than their counter-parts in the research institutes. This was most likely linked
e35,258,447,6,4268,4903,48,111,237,AdvCAECI-R,7,"to the need to generate research publications for universitypromotion, and therefore gain access to higher salary levels.4. For technology generating activities to keep pace with cur-rent ﬁeld practices the universities and research institutesneed to form greater linkages in the generation of innova-"
e35,258,448,6,4268,4903,48,111,237,AdvCAECI-R,7,tive practice. ARIs differed with the universities in thephysical distance between technology generation and
e35,259,449,6,4268,4464,304,30,239,AdvCAECI-R,7,"Based on ﬁndings in this study, the following recommenda-tions were made to improve the technology generating prac-tices of respondents in the study area."
e35,260,450,6,4268,4510,305,53,237,AdvCAECI-R,7,1. The percentage of PhD holders among respondents in ARIswas low. This study recommends that staff in researchinstitutes should be encouraged to undertake postgradu-ate doctoral studies to acquire advanced knowledge and
e35,260,451,6,4268,4510,305,53,237,AdvCAECI-R,7,research skills.
e35,261,452,6,4268,4567,305,42,237,AdvCAECI-R,7,2. University researchers should look into options of apply-ing for funding to a wider range funding bodies to helpalleviate the drain on researcher’s personal funds to gener-ate agricultural technologies.
e35,262,453,6,4268,4613,305,42,237,AdvCAECI-R,7,3. The formation of a formal technological linkage advisorycouncil would help strengthen the governance of innova-tion in Nigeria to alleviate limitations in research facilitiesand qualiﬁed human resources.
e35,263,454,6,4268,4659,305,88,237,AdvCAECI-R,7,"4.

e37,6,15,1,50,322,39,178,357,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,"Design thinking is, for many, a poor name for a serious process. It is a short-hand term for an iterative problem-solving process. It generally functions whenteams of experts work to solve problems on behalf of legitimate problem ownersand other stakeholders. The design thinking process typically involves a model inwhich practitioners go through several steps. In the earliest, seminal versions ofthe model, practitioners describe the steps as taking place in a problem space anda solution space. In the problem space, the first step is to identify a problem andexplicitly define how it is the real cause for which a solution is sought. In the solu-tion space, the second step is to propose a solution and examine the solution inan effort to ensure that the solution will, indeed, solve the causal problem. At thispoint, most models involve implementation. Most also assume that a serious prob-lem-solving process may require several iterations, with one or more new cyclesthrough each of the two spaces. This is commonly known as the double diamondmodel."
e37,7,16,1,50,504,39,191,361,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,"While this model is well known in design circles, it emerged in several fields.I first saw it in 1988, for example, in the work of Anders Skoe, a former executiveat SAS Airlines who had earlier been an economist for Canadian government agen-cies, later working in the computer industry and the airline industry. Skoe’s twobooks were training manuals for problem-solving practitioners."

It travelled becauseSITA operates in every nation with an airport. SITA manages telecommunicationsin the airline industry, between and among airlines and air transport serviceproviders, in more than two hundred nations and territories. In developing andrefining his model, Skoe worked in more than one hundred and sixty-five nations,later working in the Scandinavian design industry to help design firms solve clientproblems, while Skoe’s trainees moved from SITA into other high-tech industriesand consulting firms."

e37,85,264,5,3515,3563,59,9,344,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,Here we come to a crucial aspect in Murphy’s article: the role of explanation in
e37,86,265,5,3515,3576,39,9,41,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,research.
e37,87,266,5,3515,3589,39,165,362,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,"Research requires explanation. It requires explanatory power and demands anarrative account if it is to produce knowledge for all members of a research field,a discipline, or a profession. This is why we describe research as “a contributionto the knowledge of the field.” In this article, Murphy gives particular attention todoctoral research. He distinguishes between description and explanation—linkingextended explanation to the demonstration of serious research in a Ph.D. thesis.One criterion of the Ph.D. as a research doctorate involves making “an originalcontribution to the knowledge of the field”—sometimes described in shorter formas “an original contribution to knowledge.” The ability to engage in independentresearch is the fundamental criterion for awarding a research doctorate. The Ph.D.thesis is a demonstration that the apprentice researcher is able to do research—the“journeyman piece” that warrants admission to the guild of practicing researchprofessionals."
e37,88,267,5,3515,3757,59,9,341,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,"The thesis rests on the importance of explanation, and it requires an epistemo-"
e37,89,268,5,3515,3770,39,74,364,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,"logical distinction between information and knowledge. We cannot share knowl-edge directly, mind to mind. We can only share information about what we know.When we engage in research, we learn something that becomes our knowledge.We share information by writing reports, papers, articles, and books, or presentingthese less formally in talks. One of the confusing issues in discussions of research isthat many of the same initial steps that lead to learning also lead to research."
e37,90,269,5,3515,3848,39,87,360,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,"One key difference between learning and research is that what we learn maybe new to us while it is not new to others, as we see in the case of the bright childwho rediscovers the Pythagorean theorem. Learning often involves original dis-covery for the individual that is neither original nor new to the world. This may beresearch for the individual in the same sense as “collecting of information about aparticular subject.”"
e37,90,270,5,3515,3848,39,87,360,GillSansMT-Bold,6,31
e37,90,271,5,3515,3848,39,87,360,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,This kind of research does not warrant publication or a re-search degree.
e37,91,272,5,3515,3940,59,9,344,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,Another key difference between learning and research is that research involves
e37,92,273,5,3515,3953,39,87,359,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,"information that is new to the others with whom we share it. Serious research en-ables others to learn in turn from our questions, our methods, or our conclusions.Research creates knowledge for researchers and information for the field.When other members of the field integrate this information into their knowledge,it becomes the knowledge of the field. In his article, Peter Murphy offers a richoverview of the epistemological challenges of design research, locating them inthree epistemological traditions."
e37,93,274,5,3515,4044,39,61,364,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,It is possible to frame design research in other ways. Murphy focuses on JohnDewey’s approach to pragmatism; one could also examine George Herbert Mead’sapproach.
e37,93,275,5,3515,4044,39,61,364,GillSansMT-Bold,6,32
e37,93,276,5,3515,4044,39,61,364,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,"Mead’s work led in turn to symbolic interactionism, and to the con-structivist tradition. Hermeneutics offers another useful epistemology for grapplingwith design as meaningful communication."
e37,94,277,5,3515,4109,39,139,362,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,"There are other ways to understand the world—but not all of these involveresearch. Art offers a rich and legitimate approach to understanding the world—it involves revelation, not explanation. Murphy’s elegant distinctions honor thenecessities of art without neglecting the necessities of explanation in researchepistemology. Murphy articulates a useful critique of the failure to demonstrate ex-planatory knowledge in what is sometimes labeled “practice-based research.” Muchof this work is not research at all: it is a justification for advancing the careers of"
e37,94,278,5,3515,4109,39,139,362,SwiftNeueLTPro-Book,9,people whose work does not warrant a Ph.D. by redefining research in implausible

Han Shan wrote his poetry onrocks and walls, working in a monastery kitchen to earn a living.

For those who chose explanation, theclassics, and the law, this was the path to advancement—not unlike today’s univer-sity research system. Han Shan chose another path, and he did not confuse the twoepistemological traditions, demanding a civil service career while living the life of anartist."

e38,32,45,2,910,1111,51,91,251,GulliverRM,7,"Speciﬁcally, the origin of the debate on corporate social respon-sibility goes back to the early twentieth century, where theintensity where the intensity of increased production merges withthe second phase of the Industrial Revolution highlighting West-ern Europe, United States of America and Japan.

e38,33,46,2,910,1205,51,133,251,GulliverRM,7,"The situation experienced in this period led authors such asWeber (1922) and Clark (1939) to express the need to educatebusinesspeople towards a new framework of social responsibility.In these efforts, leading business schools, with Harvard as a refer-ence point, and professional magazines like Fortune have joined ina common purpose: to demonstrate that executives and managersof companies, might achieve a competitive management modelthrough responsible guidance of their actions from an economicpoint of view (i.e., ensuring the payment of wages for employees,suppliers responsibilities in contracts, reduction of risk for share-holders, etc.). Moreover, it is necessary from a social point of view toidentify improvement aims for the common good of the communityin which ﬁrms operate."
e38,34,47,2,910,1341,51,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"Based on these initial contributions, the ﬁrst work arose in theﬁfties, formally deﬁning the concept of social responsibility as ‘"

Therefore, in addition to considering theeconomic function, organizations should contemplate the socialconsequences resulting from their actions. From this work, the con-cept of social responsibility starts to take on increased interest as aresearch topic as Carroll (1999) postulates, a work which examinesin detail the evolution of the concept, subdividing the decade intodifferent key periods that have helped the progressive institution-alization of this mental attitude of responsibility between businessand academia."
e38,36,51,2,910,1529,51,133,251,GulliverRM,7,"Among these works, it is necessary to highlight the ideas ofDrucker (1954) who discusses the need to take the factor of publicopinion into account in the decision making process of any organi-zation, regardless of size or industry. According to the author, thisidea is based on the experiences of multinationals such as Ford andGeneral Motors, which in the mid-50s received much criticism fromthe press, media and various national regulatory institutions, due tothe development of behaviours qualiﬁed as ‘irresponsible’, whichhad not considered the interest of their communities. These compa-nies had to take further action to regain the trust of these customers(creating channels of communication, collaborating with environ-mental organizations, implementing a social volunteer programmefor employees, etc.). With these arguments Drucker reﬂects that"
e38,37,52,2,910,975,320,28,251,GulliverRM,7,"even major companies are subjected to an environment of widesocial pressure, which consequently determine their actions in themarket in the long term."
e38,38,53,2,910,1006,320,143,251,GulliverRM,7,"Regarding these ideas, in the early sixties, Davis (1960) con-tributed to the concept of social responsibility, suggesting that,depending on the number of agents affected by organizationalactions, they must look after their interests in order to win theirendorsement and support. Therefore, Davis advised that orga-nizations that use their power without worrying about causingimpact on the environment might lose the respect and trust oftheir stakeholders (customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders,etc.), qualities that Davis considers determinants for success andbusiness consolidation. This idea will be developed in literaturethrough the trend termed ‘corporate constitutionalism’, which con-templates the ﬁrm as a social institution that must exercise itspower responsibly, with their groups’ interest at heart, in ordernot to be punished and expelled from the market (Davis, 1960)."
e38,39,54,2,910,1153,320,143,251,GulliverRM,7,"Since the mid-sixties, Davis (1967) frames the studies of socialresponsibility as a macro organizational issue that goes beyondinternal and technicians’ interest of any company. So far, the workspublished highlight how the assumption of greater responsibil-ity on the part of the companies could improve their results inrelation to particular interest groups. However, Davis’ proposalssuggest the need for organizational activities to be developedin line with the institutional context that surrounds and affectsbusinesses, it being necessary to know what other companies(competitors or ﬁrms which belong in the same sector) and institu-tions require in economic and social terms. This process, accordingto Davis, is what helps companies to redeﬁne their responsibili-ties and commitments regarding their agents, who make up theircommunity."
e38,40,55,2,910,1299,320,185,251,GulliverRM,7,"Taking into account the previous contributions, Walton (1967)stressed that social responsibility emerges as a set of actions thatmanagers try to implement for companies to improve their rela-tionship with the broad range of interest groups that make up theirenvironment. In addition, Walton (1967) made a decisive contri-bution to the understanding of what social responsibility is, andhow it can be activated among organizations. In this regard, Wal-ton highlights that the essential ingredient of social responsibility isthe degree of voluntariness by business, because such action is notmandatory, and the decision to carry it out involves the assumptionof a signiﬁcant cost and risk, which can affect the success or failureof a business in a decisive way. Therefore, considering the imbal-ances and the investment required to develop social responsibilityactions, authors like Wallich and Mcgowan (1970) added that, withregard to the viability of social responsibility action, which mayensure a company’s success, and to conduct their activities withoutrestrictions, they must maintain a balance between the economicand social interests of their stakeholders."

e38,47,62,3,1771,1867,40,70,251,GulliverRM,7,"For decades organizational strategies and actions have beenadapted to requirements and environmental pressures (Fernández-Allés & Valle-Cabrera, 2006). Following this argument, the responseto the context in which companies operate and keep their actionsand behaviours consistent with principles demanded by externaland internal context is considered vital for organizational survival(Dacin, 1997; Fuenfschilling & Truffer, 2014)."
e38,48,63,3,1771,1940,40,123,251,GulliverRM,7,"This internalization process of a set of norms, beliefs, values andprinciples accepted by society and the community allow organiza-tions to achieve the support and backing of their activity, which isknown as legitimacy (Cruz-Suárez, Prado-Román, & Díez-Martín,2014; Suchman, 1995). Among the advantages of the legitima-tion process, organizations could achieve more efﬁcient access toresources from certain stakeholders – investor funds, support fromgovernment, increased sales and customer loyalty, access to thenegotiation of contracts with different suppliers and distributors,obtaining the respect and commitment of employees, etc., as aprocess that helps to improve the organization’s economic andﬁnancial performance (Brammer, Jackson, & Matten, 2012)."
e38,49,64,3,1771,2066,40,279,251,GulliverRM,7,"Internally, institutionalization and internalization of norms, val-ues and social behaviours and structures arises from formal andinformal processes, which take place between internal groupswithin the company (DiMaggio & Powell, 1991). Moreover, theexternal environment is considered essential with regard to thepossibility of establishing a set of relationships between thecompany and Government laws and regulations, professional asso-ciations (licensing and certiﬁcation) and other organizations, espe-cially those that are within the same sector (Fernández-Allés, 2001).Regarding this, DiMaggio and Powell (1983) point out that com-panies will adapt more efﬁciently to their environment and canachieve legitimacy and the beneﬁts they derive from it if they:(i) Consider the legal and political pressure exerted externally byagencies such as the Government – coercive isomorphism – dueto the fact that there is a creator and regulatory power enhancerand promoter of change rules, which inspects and punishes accord-ingly; (ii) Mimic the processes, practices and strategies of themost successful companies – mimetic isomorphism. In this pro-cess it could be argued that cognitive power, i.e. a set of beliefs,assumptions and explicit knowledge, codiﬁed and specialized, is aframework through which to perform organizational routines thathelp internalize these best practices; and ﬁnally; (iii) Collaboratewith professionals, taking into account the experience and previoustraining of managerial personnel to generate a professional knowl-edge that will address the problems of the environment for ﬁrmswith greater conﬁdence – normative isomorphism (Fernández-Allés, 2001)."
e38,50,65,3,1771,2348,40,60,251,GulliverRM,7,"Although the result of the mechanisms of isomorphism impliesthat organizations are very similar, empirical evidence shows thatthose using these processes can improve their position in the mar-ket, getting their business to be perceived as desired by publicinstitutions and the wide range of their community stakeholders(Schultz & Wehmeier, 2010)."
e38,51,66,3,1771,2411,40,91,251,GulliverRM,7,"These contributions, framed within the approach of old insti-tutionalism, help to explain why organizations view the imitationof behaviours identiﬁed in their environment as able to ensure thelegitimacy of the groups and institutions that shape it. However,the new institutional trend, conceived as neo-institutionalism,suggests that organizations and their strategies are substantiallyinﬂuenced by cultural factors, legal, historical and political institu-tions that deﬁne speciﬁc patterns of behaviour for different regionsor countries (Doh & Guay, 2006; Powell & DiMaggio, 2012)."
e38,52,67,3,1771,2505,40,18,251,GulliverRM,7,Support of this neo-institutional basis might explain whatinﬂuence these factors have on the socially responsible actions
e38,53,68,3,1771,1836,309,39,251,GulliverRM,7,"undertaken by companies. Signiﬁcant within this institutional con-temporary framework is the theoretical support of Keim (2003),who identiﬁes several institutions that should be considered in theanalysis of the context:"
e38,54,69,3,1771,1877,309,154,251,GulliverRM,7,"(i) Formal institutions, which are constitutions, laws, policiesand formal agreements created and validated by citizens from dif-ferent localities and countries; (ii) informal institutions, which rulebehaviour and mental models and are generated by individualsvia cultural heritage, religious beliefs or policies. These rules, inthe ﬁeld of business, are coded as informal practices and routi-nes. In addition, there are some key institutions for national andsupranational political, legal and social legislation, from whichjurisdiction speciﬁc to a particular territory or geographic areaemanates. Following this classiﬁcation, to examine the implemen-tation of socially responsible behaviours among companies, theinstitutional environment is interpreted in contexts such as Europeand North America, traditionally marked by different historical andpolitical factors, which affect the particular way in which respectivecompanies make decisions about social responsibility."
e38,55,70,3,1771,2034,309,154,251,GulliverRM,7,"Focusing the analysis on European territory, due to Spain beingthe country in which the research is framed, it should be mentionedthat there has been a high turnover of policies at the communitylevel by different Member States, determining the generation of alarge number of legislations to harmonize laws and regulations. Forexample: the Maastricht Treaty, 1993; Amsterdam Treaty, 1996;Treaty of Nice, 2000 (Doh, 1999; Doh & Guay, 2006). The inte-gration of these countries under a monetary system and commongovernment inﬂuence can affect the reformulation of traditionalrelationships between businesses and Governments, aimed in thiscase at achieving a coherent system of welfare in these Europeancountries (Doh, 1999). Concretely, bodies such as the EuropeanCommission, the Parliament and the Spanish Council of Ministriesare positioned as expert advisors on negotiation and improvementof these collective European interests."
e38,56,71,3,1771,2191,309,227,251,GulliverRM,7,"In terms of CSR at the European level, the elaboration and pub-lication of the Green Book of CSR by the European Commission(2001) is highlighted as one of the prime manuscripts to pro-mote a common framework in which responsible behaviour forentrepreneurs and managers may be developed within the Euro-pean Union. Despite the importance of these European ﬁgures inthe formulation of policies and procedures which promote socialresponsibility, according to Doh and Teegen (2002) and Doh andGuay (2006), reﬂect that NGOs and the general public have beentwo of the main promoters at institutional level to have driven theimperative to develop socially responsible behaviours in ﬁrms dur-ing recent decades. More speciﬁcally, negative ecological impactssuch as discharges of toxic air pollution by companies, or sociallynegative impacts such as gender inequalities or the use of childlabour have led to several platforms being built and to NGOsexpressing their dissatisfaction, expressing the need for more regu-lation of these aspects. With these arguments there is a progressiveinstitutionalization and concern by companies to develop respon-sible behaviour, leading to numerous studies that have attemptedto demonstrate the relevance and added value of including socialresponsibility as a part of organizational goals (Branco & Rodrigues,2006)."
e38,57,72,3,1771,2421,309,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"Other factors such as the ﬁnancial position in the market, thelevel of enterprise competitiveness, or a history of political bag-gage in some countries, encourage ﬁrms to position themselves ascomplementary constraints in the course of implementing sociallyresponsible behaviour (Campbell, 2007; Sementelli, 2005)."

These previous works use a double distinctionof stakeholders by way of consensus regarding their nature and therelationship established with the organization: (i) a primary group,which usually has a formal contract with the ﬁrm and is essential forits proper functioning (owners, shareholders, employees, unions,customers, suppliers, etc.) and (ii) a secondary group which, despitenot being directly involved in the economic activities of the com-pany and not having a contractual relationship with it, can exercisea signiﬁcant inﬂuence on its activity (citizens, competitors, localcommunity, the Government, public, etc.)."
e38,66,83,4,2632,3010,51,196,251,GulliverRM,7,"The inﬂuence, power and claims that each of these parts have onthe company has been analyzed in works such as Mitchell, Agle, andWood (1997). In this regard, a solid and broad theoretical frame-work has been built related to the stakeholders theory, that showshow satisfying the interests of these parties can help companies toimprove their ﬁnancial performance and subsequently their com-petitiveness and sustainability (Harrison, Bosse, & Phillips, 2010).Speciﬁcally, Goodpaster (1991), Donaldson and Preston (1995) andFassin (2009) argue that there are different forms of analysingand studying the management of interest by companies. Thus,Goodpaster (1991) appreciates three theoretical trends that explainthe behaviour of ﬁrms in relation to their stakeholders. Firstly, thestrategic approach, which argues that stakeholders can facilitate orhinder the achievement of the organizational aims. Secondly, theresponsibility approach, which explains how establishing a qualityrelationship with those groups of interest, can provide more bene-ﬁts for companies through achieving their satisfaction. Thirdly, theconvergent approach which stands as an intermediate trend fromboth previous approaches."
e38,67,84,4,2632,3209,51,123,251,GulliverRM,7,"Additionally, Donaldson and Preston (1995) propose anotherthree trends to examine and analyze stakeholders managementwith accuracy: (i) the descriptive approach, which aims to explainthat companies are deﬁned by a broad set of different interests thatmust be balanced, a process that can induce better or worse results;(ii) the instrumental approach, which explains how the stakeholdermanagement of the company is an instrument or a tool to meetspeciﬁc, traditional organizational goals: proﬁtability, stability andgrowth and (iii) the normative approach, supported by the fact thatthe management and satisfaction of stakeholder interests shouldbe the main goal to be achieved by the company, leaving economicbeneﬁts in second place."

(1997), stakeholder theory shows that thebehaviour of the company will be inﬂuenced not only by agentswith great power and dependence on the organization (sharehol-ders, employees, investors, etc.), but also by other outside groups"
e38,69,86,4,2632,2717,320,248,251,GulliverRM,7,"For example, Henriques and Sadorsky (1999) found that theperception of interests and environmental demands of particularinterest groups did signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the level of environmen-tal commitment adopted by companies in their practices. For thesereasons, Phillips, Freeman, and Wicks (2003) proposed to adaptand modernize stakeholder’s theory into a version able to captureand simplify these groups into ﬁve internal categories: ﬁnancialcontrol agents (e.g. shareholders), customers, suppliers, employ-ees and communities in which the company operates (includingcompetitors). Phillips also proposes six speciﬁc external groups:the Government, environmental organizations, NGOs, professionalcritics or experts, the media and others in general (citizens, localor those which affect or will be affected by companies). The rea-son why these groups may have an inﬂuence on the company,although they do not control essential resources, is explained bythe legitimacy concept (Lee, 2011). In the words of Scott (2007:45) legitimacy ‘is not a commodity to be possessed or exchangedby companies, but rather a condition that reﬂects the culturalalignment, normative support, or consonance with the rules orlaws of the environment’. This idea leads us to uncover a naturaland complementary theoretical link between institutional theoryand stakeholder approach, given the inﬂuence that interest groupscould have on the implementation of socially responsible behaviourrequired of the companies by society."
e38,70,87,4,2632,2968,320,60,251,GulliverRM,7,"On the basis of theoretical arguments presented, we can con-clude that both the institutional theory and stakeholders approachrepresent two solid pillars to explain and analyze the incorpora-tion of corporate social responsibility actions by ﬁrms (Fernando &Lawrence, 2014; Marano & Kostova, 2015; Verbeke & Tung, 2013)as Fig. 1 illustrates."
e38,71,88,4,2632,3031,320,123,251,GulliverRM,7,"In this way, the institutional pillars proposed by DiMaggio andPowell (1983), reﬂect how the pressure on companies may con-dition their decisions in terms of social responsibility actions.According to Clarkson (1995), it will be necessary to distinguishand consider the inﬂuence they can further exert upon externalgroups affected by or affecting business activity interest. Thesemechanisms composing the external macro-context of the com-pany are of great importance for companies’ attention, somethingthat will determine their survival in the market. Internally, themicro-context would consist of those domestic interest groupswith links to the company, able to exercise power over decisionson social responsibility as expressed in Fig. 1."

To achieve this process, CED proposes threekey functions that companies must undertake to behave respon-sibly according to their role in society: (i) an internal function ofan economic nature aimed at the distribution of products and ser-vices that will generate jobs and inject income into the community;(ii) an intermediate function that meets the expectations, valuesand social priorities of the stakeholders and (iii) an external func-tion, which tries to reduce social and environmental imbalances in"

Similarly, McWilliams, Siegel, and Wright (2006)argue that corporate social responsibility acts as an enabler forcompanies involved, according to their characteristics and objec-tives, social and environmental actions as well as other emergingdemands of society, the industry and community. The above state-ments highlight how the size or organizational structure of acompany may affect the deﬁnition of CSR objectives."

According to Dahlsrud after analyzing 37 deﬁnitions ofCSR, there is no description arising out of optimum performancederivative actions on social responsibility, and how those can affectthe decision making of the company. Additionally, the analysis ofDahlsrud shows that issues such as globalization, the new dynamicand competitive context in which business operates, the new actorsand international laws are changing the expectations that soci-ety places on businesses and altering the way of citizens’ lives.From the work of Van Marrewijk and Dahlsrud it can be extractedthat the term CSR has evolved in parallel with the environmentand the expectations of society in business.

Addi-tionally, a coherent and consistent pattern is appreciable in theconceptual proposal regarding CSR in the literature, describing aphenomenon increasingly latent in society, although there are stillno tools or guidance on how to manage its effects.

Within these intangible effects, it will be extremely relevantto examine how corporate social responsibility can generate sharedvalue. According to Porter and Kramer (2011), the term-sharedvalue involves creating economic value in a way that also createsvalue for society by addressing its needs and challenges. Consider-ing the approaches reviewed in the current article, the concept ofshared value is implicitly related to the essence of institutional per-spectives and stakeholders, trying to provide a value in response tothe needs and requirements of society and stakeholders.

We estimate the time-invariant and time-variant efﬁcienciesof Swedish ﬁnancial enterprises with four different estimators. These estimators are the Pooled Model(Aigner et al., 1977), the ﬁxed effects model (Schmidt & Sickles, 1984), the random effects model (Battese& Coelli, 1995) and the TRUE ﬁxed effects model (Greene, 2005) efﬁciency estimators. We predict costfunction by employing panel stochastic frontier approach. These allow us to construct cost efﬁciency."

e40,15,20,1,50,518,51,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"Before 1980, ﬁnancial markets were highly regulated in Sweden.Much credit ﬂowed outside the regulated market and challengedthe traditional role of banks. In response, banks tried to bypassinterest rate regulations by establishing their own ﬁnance com-panies, which formed an important part of the gray credit market(Berg et al., 1993). The term ‘gray economy’, however, refers toworkers being reimbursed under-the-table, without paying incometaxes or contributing to such public services as Social Security andMedicare. It is sometimes referred to as the underground economyor “hidden economy” in Sweden (Biljer, 1991)."
e40,16,21,1,50,622,51,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"As the regulations were increasingly considered to be largelyineffective, the authorities initiated a ﬁnancial liberalization pro-cess in the late 1970s that proceeded through the 1980s. Credit andbond markets were deregulated ﬁrst; regulations on internationaltransactions were removed next. The system of liquidity ratios forbanks was abandoned in 1983 and the ceilings on commercialbank lending were removed in 1985. At the same time, restric-tions on lending rates were lifted. By 1989, all remaining foreignexchange restrictions had been removed (Dress & Pazarbasioglu,1998)."

e40,19,28,1,50,497,320,133,251,GulliverRM,7,"on consumption and investment appearsto have been limited. Expressed differently, the rationing effects ofthe abolished regulations do not seem to have been quantitativelyimportant to the real decisions of households and corporations.On the other hand, ﬁnancial ﬂows were undoubtedly affected inan important way (Ahmet et al., 2011). Credits were increasinglychannelled by ﬁnancial institutions, such as banks and mort-gage institutions, rather than directly between ﬁrms (for exampletrade credits) and households (for example seller ﬁnanced housingloans). Loans were also increasingly used for high-leverage ﬁnancialinvestments. These effects on ﬁnancial ﬂows may, if their impacton asset prices is any indication, have affected the banking crisis(Fig. 1) (Englund, 1999)."
e40,20,29,1,50,633,320,70,251,GulliverRM,7,"We estimate the time-invariant and time-variant efﬁcienciesof Swedish ﬁnancial enterprises. These estimators are the PooledModel (Aigner, Lovell, & Schmidt, 1977), the ﬁxed effects model(Schmidt & Sickles, 1984), the random effects model (Battese &Coelli, 1995) and the TRUE ﬁxed effects model (Greene, 2005). Wepredict cost function by employing the panel stochastic frontierapproach. This allows us to build cost efﬁciency."
e40,21,30,1,50,706,320,60,251,GulliverRM,7,"In this research, the cost measure was estimated for the paneldata utilising six different ﬁnancial enterprises from 1996 to 2011.These ﬁnancial enterprises comprise banks (including commercialbanks, branches of foreign banks in Sweden and saving banks),credit market companies, housing credit institutions, other mort-gage institutions, other credit market companies and securities"

e40,45,56,2,910,1330,40,143,251,GulliverRM,7,"The stochastic frontier approach (SFA) pertains to the theoreti-cal literature on productive efﬁciency that began in the 1950s withthe work of Koopmans (1951), Debreu (1951) and Shephard (1953).Koopmans provides a deﬁnition of technical efﬁciency: a produceris technically efﬁcient if and only if it is impossible to producemore of any output without producing less of some other output orwithout using more of some input. Debreu and Shephard introducedistance functions as a way of modelling multiple-output technol-ogy and – more importantly, from our perspective – as a way ofmeasuring the radial distance of a producer from a frontier in eitheran output-expanding direction (Debreu) or an input-conservingdirection (Shephard). The association of distance functions withtechnical efﬁciency measures is pivotal in developing the efﬁciencymeasurement literature."
e40,46,57,2,910,1477,40,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"Farrell (1957) was the ﬁrst to measure productive efﬁciencyempirically (drawing inspiration from Koopmans and Debreu butclearly not from Shephard). He also provides an empirical appli-cation for U.S. agriculture, although he did not use econometricmethods."
e40,47,58,2,910,1529,40,133,251,GulliverRM,7,"Aigner et al. (1977) (ALS hereafter) propose a model in whicherrors were allowed to be both positive and negative but in whichpositive and negative errors could be assigned different weights.Ordinary least squares emerge as a special case of equal weights,and a deterministic frontier model emerges as another special case.They consider estimation for the case in which the weights areknown and for the more difﬁcult case in which the weights areunknown and are to be estimated with the other parameters inthe model. They do not estimate the model and, to our knowledge,no one else has done so either. Nonetheless, there is a short stepfrom the Aigner, Amemiya and Poirier model (with larger weightsattached to negative errors) to a comprised error stochastic pro-duction frontier model. The step took a year. SFA originated with"
e40,48,59,2,910,1246,309,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"two papers published nearly simultaneously by two teams on twocontinents. The ALS paper is in fact a merged version of a pair ofremarkably similar papers: one by Aigner and the other by Lovelland Schmidt. The ALS and Meeusen and van den Broeck (MB here-after) papers are themselves very similar. Both papers were threeyears in the making and both appeared shortly before a third SFApaper by Battese and Corra (1977), the senior author of which hadbeen a referee of the ALS paper. These three original SFA mod-els share the comprised error structure mentioned previously, andeach was developed in a production frontier context."
e40,49,60,2,910,1350,309,112,251,GulliverRM,7,"Schmidt and Sickles (1984) apply ﬁxed effects and randomeffects models to estimate the efﬁciencies of the ﬁrms. In theirstudy, the efﬁciencies of the ﬁrms are assumed to be time-invariant,which might not be a proper assumption for long panel data.Accordingly, they consider estimating a stochastic frontier produc-tion model, given panel data. They provide various estimators thatdepend on whether one is willing to assume that technical inefﬁ-ciency (the individual effect, in panel-data jargon) is uncorrelatedwith the regressions and whether one is willing to make speciﬁcdistributional assumptions for the errors. They show how to testthese assumptions."
e40,50,61,2,910,1465,309,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"Battese and Coelli (1995) propose a model for technical inefﬁ-ciency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for paneldata. Provided the inefﬁciency effects are stochastic, the modelallows for the estimation of both technical change in the stochasticfrontier and time-varying technical inefﬁciencies."
e40,51,62,2,910,1518,309,81,251,GulliverRM,7,"Greene (2005) proposes extensions that circumvent two short-comings of ﬁxed and random effects estimator approaches. Theconventional panel data estimators assume that technical or costinefﬁciency is time invariant. Second, the ﬁxed and random effectsestimators force any time invariant cross unit heterogeneity intothe same term that is being used to capture the inefﬁciency. Inef-ﬁciency measures in these models may pick up heterogeneity inaddition to or even instead of inefﬁciency."

They ﬁnd the various efﬁciency methods do not necessarilyyield consistent results and suggest some ways that these methods

Almost all of the studies that estimateefﬁciency and then regress it on sets of explanatory variables havebeen unable to explain more than just a small portion of the totalvariation. While some differences have been found, little publishedinformation exists about those inﬂuences that are under directmanagement control, such as the choice of funding sources whole-sale versus retail orientation, etc. Cost and productive efﬁciencyaverage 84 percent when parametric estimation techniques areused and 72 percent when nonparametric techniques are used."
e40,56,67,3,1771,1940,51,123,251,GulliverRM,7,"In the Swedish case, Battese et al.’s (2000) paper aims to ana-lyse the impact of the deregulation of Swedish banking industryin the mid-1980s and the consequent banking crisis on productiveefﬁciency and productivity growth in the industry. An unbalancedpanel of Swedish banks is studied over the period of 1984–1995.A total of 1275 observations are analysed for 156 banks observed.The inefﬁciency effects in the labour-use frontier are modelled interms of the number of branches, total inventories and the typeof bank and year of observation. The technical inefﬁciencies of thelabour use of Swedish banks are signiﬁcant, with mean inefﬁcien-cies a year estimated to be between about 8 and 15 percent overthe years of study."

A translog stochastic frontier model is adopted inorder to estimate the labour input requirement function and toassess bank technical efﬁciency. Furthermore, the parameters ofthe stochastic frontier function are simultaneously estimated withthe parameters of a model for the technical inefﬁciency effects. Theanalysis suggests that there is capacity for substantial labour efﬁ-ciency improvements in the Swedish banking industry. It is alsoshown that deregulation positively affects productivity growth.However, no such positive impact is found on labour use efﬁciency.In addition, the banking crisis affected the efﬁciency of labourutilization in Swedish banks in a negative way, considering theinvolved outputs and inputs (“effects of deregulation and bankingcrisis on the labour use efﬁciency in Swedish banking industry”).The fast pace of changes in the economic environment and theincreasing globalization of ﬁnancial services dictate an increase inthe awareness of ﬁnancial institutions regarding their economicperformance."

The ﬁndings suggest that the largest banks are the least efﬁ-cient, and the smallest banks are the most efﬁcient. The strongesteconomies of scale are displayed by Danish banks, while the weak-est economies of scale are reported by Finnish banks. The ﬁndingssuggest that medium-sized banks report the strongest economiesof scale and the largest and smallest banks weaker economies ofscale and therefore the notion that economies of scale increase withbank size cannot be conﬁrmed. The impact of technical change inlessening bank costs (generally about 3% and 5, 4% an annual) sys-tematically increases with bank size. The largest banks reap thegreatest beneﬁts from technical changes. Overall, the results showthat the largest banks in their sample enjoy greater beneﬁts fromtechnical progress, although they do not have scale economy andefﬁciency advantages over smaller banks."

Onthe other hand, parametric techniques assume that the inefﬁcien-cies follow an asymmetric distribution. That is, they assume thatthe half-normal and random errors follow a symmetric distribution,the standard normal. In other words, random factors are assumedto be identically distributed as normal variants, and the value of theerror term in the cost function is equal to zero on the average. Thus,inefﬁciency scores are derived from a normal distribution"

These ﬁnancialenterprises comprise banks (including commercial banks, branchesof foreign banks in Sweden and saving banks), credit market com-panies, housing credit institutions, other mortgage institutions,other credit market companies and securities brokerage compa-nies. The database of each enterprise has been aggregated by theStatistics Sweden. We use two distinct dependent and nine inde-pendent variables consisting of ﬁve outputs and four inputs. Themaximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters of the modelare obtained using a modiﬁcation of the econometric software.Descriptive statistics of the key variables are presented in Table 2."

Next, Banks (saving, commercial andinvestment) are successful in these ﬁnancial enterprises. Accord-ingly, the credit market companies have the worst efﬁciency scoresin the ﬁnancial system. Housing credit intuitions and credit marketinstitutions are higher in inefﬁciency than the other four ﬁnancialenterprises (Table 6). Housing credit intuitions and credit marketinstitutions have especially been affected by some enterprise scan-dals. This affects efﬁciency for the housing credit intuitions. In 2011and 2010, the inefﬁciency score of the housing credit intuitionswas the highest of all the years.

e40,357,1281,6,4353,4805,309,102,251,GulliverRM,7,"In this paper, our main motivation is to analyse how efﬁciency inSwedish ﬁnancial enterprises has changed since the banking crisisof 1993. We estimate the time-invariant and time-varying inefﬁ-ciencies of Swedish ﬁnancial enterprises from 1996 to 2011 withfour different estimators. These estimators are the Pooled Model(Aigner et al., 1977), the ﬁxed effects model (Schmidt & Sickles,1984), the random effects model (Battese & Coelli, 1995) and theTRUE FM effects model (Greene, 2005). We predict the cost functionby employing the panel stochastic frontier approach. This allows usto construct the cost efﬁciency."
e40,358,1282,6,4353,4909,309,81,251,GulliverRM,7,"In this research, we are estimated cost function for the panel dataconsisting of six different ﬁnancial enterprises from 1996 to 2011.These ﬁnancial enterprises comprise banks (including commer-cial banks, foreign banks’ branches in Sweden and saving banks),credit market companies, housing credit institutions, other mort-gage institutions, other credit market companies and securitiesbrokerage companies. Each of the enterprise’s databases is aggre-gated by the Statistics Sweden."
e40,359,1283,6,4353,4993,309,112,251,GulliverRM,7,"Ultimately, the estimates for the stochastic cost inefﬁciency,using these approaches, reveal the overall Swedish Financial Sys-tem estimated ‘cost efﬁciency scores’. This shows that the othermortgage institutions are more efﬁcient than other ﬁnancial enter-prises. Moreover, other credit market companies are less inefﬁcientthan other ﬁnancial enterprises. Banks (saving, commercial andinvestment) are successful in these ﬁnancial enterprises. That is,the credit market companies had the lowest efﬁciency scores inthe ﬁnancial system. Housing credit intuitions and credit marketinstitutions are higher in inefﬁciency than the other four ﬁnan-cial enterprises. These results reﬂect the period from 1990 to 1993."

e42,15,29,1,50,588,46,44,457,TimesNewRomanPSMT,9,Cloud Computing is the next generation internet based computing system which provides easy and customizableservices to the users for accessing or to work with various cloud applications. Cloud Computing provides a way tostore and access cloud data from anywhere by connecting the cloud application using internet [1]. By choosing thecloud services the users are able to store their local data in the remote data server [2]. The data stored in remote data

e42,20,36,2,842,931,47,56,457,TimesNewRomanPSMT,9,Cloud Computing security is the major concern to be addressed nowadays. If security measures are not providedproperly for data operations and transmissions then data is at high risk [3]. Since cloud computing provides a facilityfor  a  group  of  users  to  access  the  stored  data  there  is  a  possibility  of  having  high  data  risk.  Strongest  securitymeasures  are  to  be  implemented  by  identifying  security  challenge  and  solutions  to  handle  these  challenges.  FromFig. 1 it is clear that how Data Security and Privacy are most important and critical factor to be considered.

e42,65,122,5,3220,3434,42,219,456,TimesNewRomanPSMT,9,Encryption is suggested as a better solution to secure information. Before storing data in cloud server it is better
e42,65,123,5,3220,3434,42,219,456,TimesNewRomanPSMT,9,"to encrypt data. Data Owner can give permission to particular group member such that data can be easily accessedby  them.  Heterogeneous  data  centric  security  is  to  be  used  to  provide  data  access  control.  A  data  security  modelcomprises of authentication, data encryption and data integrity, data recovery, user protection has to be designed toimprove the data security over cloud. To ensure privacy and data security data protection can be used as a service.To avoid access of data from other users, applying encryption on data that makes data totally unusable andnormal encryption can complicate availability. Before uploading data into the cloud the users are suggested to verifywhether the data is stored on backup drives and the keywords in files remain unchanged. Calculate the hash of thefile before uploading to cloud servers will ensure that the data is not altered. This hash calculation can be used fordata integrity but it is very difficult to maintain it.  RSA based data integrity check can be provided by combiningidentity  based  cryptography  and  RSA  Signature.  SaaS  ensures  that  there  must  be  clear  boundaries  both  at  thephysical level and application level to segregate data from different users. Distributed access control architecture canbe used for access management in cloud computing. To identify unauthorized users, using of credential or attributedbased policies are better. Permission as a service can be used to tell the user that which part of data can be accessed.Fine grained access control mechanism enables the owner to delegate most of computation intensive tasks to cloudservers without disclosing the data contents. A data driven framework can be designed for secure data processingand sharing between cloud users. Network based intrusion prevention system is used to detect threats in real-time.To compute large files with different sizes and to address remote data security RSA based storage security methodcan be used."

In  this  paper  data  security  challenges  and  solutions  are  provided  for  thesechallenges  to  overcome  the  risk  involved  in  cloud  computing.  In  future  concrete  standards  for  cloud  computingsecurity can be developed. To provide a secure data access in cloud, advanced encryption techniques can be used forstoring and retrieving data from cloud. Also proper key management techniques can be used to distribute the key tothe cloud users such that only authorized persons can access the data."

e43,30,91,2,910,1048,51,374,251,GulliverRM,7,"Aunque el estudio de la ﬁdelidad del consumidor ha centradola atención de múltiples investigaciones (p. ej., Hawkins y Vel,2013; Liu-Thompkins y Tam, 2013), no se ha conseguido, sinembargo, una deﬁnición consensuada del término. El conceptode ﬁdelidad apareció por primera vez en la literatura sobre mar-keting en los a ˜nos cuarenta y se entendía como un constructounidimensional indicado por la cuota de mercado y la ﬁdelidad con-ductual (Guest, 1944). Unos 30 a ˜nos después la ﬁdelidad comienza aentenderse como un concepto bidimensional que comprende com-ponentes actitudinales y conductuales (Day, 1969), pero aún nose han explorado las complejas interrelaciones entre estas dimen-siones, ni el proceso dinámico por el que la ﬁdelidad se iniciay se mantiene (McMullan y Gilmore, 2003). Tradicionalmente, lainvestigación sobre la lealtad del consumidor ha empleado variasmedidas comportamentales relacionadas con la compra repetida.Jacoby y Chestnut (1978) criticaron estas medidas comportamen-tales alegando que capturaban solo la parte estática de un procesodinámico y no permitían comprender los factores subyacentes ala compra repetida. Cuando las compras no están guiadas por unaclara actitud positiva, sino por exigencias situacionales, se conside-ran el resultado de una falsa lealtad. En línea con estos antecedentessobre la conceptualización y medida de la ﬁdelidad, Oliver (1999)y posteriormente McMullan y Gilmore (2003) deﬁnen la ﬁdeli-dad como"

Estos autores plantearon que el desarrollo dela lealtad de un consumidor se produce de forma secuencial a tra-vés de 4 etapas: cognitiva, afectiva, conativa, y la última etapa esla de acción, en la que la intención motivada por la fase anteriorse transforma en una disposición para actuar. McMullan y Gilmore(2003) y McMullan (2005) construyeron una escala que midiera eldesarrollo de la ﬁdelidad según el modelo de 4 fases que acabamosde describir."

Autores como Rundle-Thiele (2005) y Söderlund (2006)sugieren que la lealtad no es, necesariamente, una serie de etapasjerárquicas. Además, creen que la ﬁdelidad no debería conside-rarse siempre compuesta por actitudes favorables, intenciones ycompra repetida, sino que los consumidores pueden poseer dife-rentes grados de ﬁdelidad a través de los diferentes tipos de esta.Rundle-Thiele (2005) realiza una revisión de una amplia base demedidas de ﬁdelidad utilizadas en distintas investigaciones.

Igualmente,Sirgy y Samli (1989) y Söderlund (2006) consideran la ﬁdelidadcomo un constructo multidimensional. Söderlund (2006) muestraen su investigación cómo el hecho de obtener un único indicador delealtad puede ocultar la posibilidad de que algunas variables en lared nomológica de la lealtad puedan estar relacionadas con algunasfacetas de la ﬁdelidad, pero no con otras, lo que, indudablemente,afecta a la validez de constructo de la medida obtenida. Sus resul-tados suponen una crítica a las escalas de ﬁdelidad desarrolladaspara conseguir una única puntuación global de lealtad."
e43,32,101,2,910,1644,51,18,251,GulliverRM,7,"Para el desarrollo de nuestra escala nos centraremos en la deﬁni-ción propuesta por Oliver (1999). Sin embargo, tal y como plantean"

Por ejemplo, sería posible que un consumi-dor presentase una alta ﬁdelidad comportamental pero una bajaﬁdelidad actitudinal, o a la inversa, pudiéndose explicar estos des-ajustes mediante factores situacionales. Esta información podríausarse, por ejemplo, para adaptar la estrategia de marketing al nivelde ﬁdelidad de los consumidores en cada una de las dimensiones. Deesta forma, nuestra propuesta para la conceptualización y medidade la ﬁdelidad del consumidor consideraría 5 facetas de lealtad:propensión a ser leal, ﬁdelidad conductual, recomendaciones boca-oído, intenciones de volver a comprar y ﬁdelidad actitudinal. Estasfacetas no tienen que estar necesariamente sincronizadas ni lineal-mente relacionadas. Por este motivo, en nuestro instrumento no seplantea la obtención de una única puntuación de ﬁdelidad. Conside-ramos necesario obtener puntuaciones separadas para las distintasdimensiones de ﬁdelidad que se identiﬁquen."
e43,34,103,2,910,1184,320,7,203,GulliverIT,7,1.2. Escalas para medir la ﬁdelidad de los consumidores
e43,35,104,2,910,1205,320,457,251,GulliverRM,7,"Al revisar las medidas sobre ﬁdelidad empleadas en los distintostrabajos de investigación hemos encontrado una enorme varie-dad de ítems utilizados de forma aislada para recoger informaciónsobre distintos aspectos de la lealtad, pero solo una escala con suscorrespondientes estudios psicométricos. Se trata de la escala des-arrollada por McMullan y Gilmore (2003). Está compuesta por 28ítems que intentan medir las 4 etapas del modelo de lealtad descri-tas anteriormente. Se usó un formato de respuesta tipo Likert con 7categorías y etiquetado completo. Se realizó una validación inicialde la escala mediante un análisis factorial exploratorio (AFE), perose aplicó con algunas deﬁciencias metodológicas; esencialmente, elmétodo de extracción de factores fue un análisis de componentesprincipales y el criterio de retención de factores, la regla de Kai-ser. La inadecuación de ambos procedimientos ha sido claramentedemostrada (Ferrando y Anguiano-Carrasco, 2010), por lo que losresultados encontrados no se pueden considerar concluyentes. Porotro lado, existen algunas escalas de ﬁdelidad desarrolladas paramedir solo alguna de las facetas en las que esta puede expresarse. Setrata de los trabajos de: a) Lichtenstein, Drumwright y Braig (2004),que con una escala de 3 ítems miden el compromiso psicológico delos consumidores para comprar en una tienda; b) Nijssen, Singh,Sirdeshmukh y Holzmüeller (2003) y Sirdeshmukh, Singh y Sabol(2002), que utilizaron 4 ítems para medir la probabilidad, expre-sada por el consumidor, de comprar en una tienda en el futuro, y,por último, d) Wulf, Odekerken-Schröder y Iacobucci (2001) des-arrollaron una escala de 3 ítems para evaluar el deseo de ser unconsumidor habitual de una categoría de productos en una tienda.En todos los casos se trataba de escalas muy breves y apenas seaporta información sobre su validez. Respecto a las escalas de ﬁdeli-dad aplicadas en Espa ˜na, hemos encontrado una investigación (SetóPamies, 2003) que realiza una adaptación de una escala (Zeithaml,Berry y Parasuraman, 1996) dise ˜nada para medir una de las facetasde la lealtad, concretamente las intenciones de comportamiento. ElAFE realizado dio como resultado una estructura con 5 dimensio-nes, pero tal y como los propios autores reconocen, solo la primeradimensión consigue un valor adecuado del coeﬁciente alfa, siendonecesaria una revisión de las restantes dimensiones. Además deltrabajo anterior, hay otras investigaciones que dise ˜nan cuestiona-rios ad hoc para recoger esta información. Gómez, Arranz y Cillán(2006) investigan el efecto de los programas de ﬁdelización sobrela lealtad conductual y afectiva de los consumidores de una cadenade supermercados.

No todos los valores esta-ban dentro del intervalo especiﬁcado, por lo que se eligió el métodode estimación de mínimos cuadrados no ponderados (ULS) y seanalizó la matriz de correlaciones de Pearson siguiendo las reco-mendaciones de Lloret-Segura, Ferreres-Traver, Hernández-Baezay Tomás-Marco (2014). Encontramos un problema de redundanciaentre los ítems 11 y 12, cuya correlación alcanzó el valor de 0,82.La presencia de ítems redundantes provoca siempre problemas enel AFE, y por este motivo se eliminó el ítem 11, que presentaba unacorrelación ítem-resto del test algo inferior a la obtenida por el ítem12. Tanto la medida de adecuación muestral de Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin(0,832) como la prueba de esfericidad de Barlett (p < 0,0001) nosmuestran que los datos son adecuados para realizar el AFE. Paradecidir del número de factores a retener se aplicó el método delanálisis paralelo (Timmerman y Lorenzo-Seva, 2011). Se utilizó elprograma Factor v.9.3.1, desarrollado por Lorenzo-Seva y Ferrando(2006). Los resultados indicaron que el número de factores a reteneres 3.

Por lo tanto,para las empresas es muy importante saber qué factores inﬂuyensobre la lealtad de sus consumidores. Para profundizar en nues-tro conocimiento sobre estos factores es fundamental disponerde instrumentos de medida que nos permitan obtener puntuacio-nes válidas y ﬁables para las distintas dimensiones de la ﬁdelidadidentiﬁcadas. Que sepamos, hasta el momento no se disponía deninguna escala basada en un proceso de construcción y análisispsicométrico detallado. La importancia de adaptar las escalas a losdistintos entornos culturales ha sido ya sobradamente demostradaen la medida de constructos muy variados, por ejemplo, en el casode la personalidad de las marcas y en el contexto espa ˜nol por Aaker,Benet-Martínez y Garolera (2001)."

Design researchers came to be-lieve that before they could impact the way design iscarried out, they must ﬁrst understand in depth howdesigners actually think. At that point, the design pro-cess had stopped being mystiﬁed and, as Lindgaardand Wesselius observed, the then-new ﬁelds of cogni-tive psychology and cognitive science were looked atas facilitating paths into thinking in design. Anotheroften overlooked force that kindled the interest indesign thinking was the impact of the postmodernculture starting in the 1970s. Postmodernists werevery interested in processes of creation—in literature,theater, cinema, art, and design. In architecturaldesign, for example, this was reﬂected in unprece-dented attention to preliminary sketches. Whereassuch sketches used to be discarded after a designsolution was solidiﬁed, and were never published orexhibited, they were henceforth archived and pub-lished in professional magazines and books. Casesin point are the thumbnail sketches made by JamesStirling in the 1970s for three museums in Germany—of which only one was built—that were published inprestigious professional magazines."

Therecent incarnation of design methods in the formof design thinking was therefore somewhat risky tobegin with, as it was not clear whether it resolves theincompatibilities between the way designers thinkand the use of prescribed methods. Design thinkingmethods differ from the methods of the 1960s,though. They are less speciﬁc and more general andﬂexible; they are more like guidelines than detailedoperational steps. Therefore, they induce less resis-tance, but—as we know—opposition does exist allthe same, and many predict that design thinking asa method will soon face the same fate as the designmethods of the 1960s."

In analogy,on the other hand, what is transferred is a relation-ship—the relations between features or componentsA and B of the source are similar to the relationsbetween features or components C and D in the target(relationship of relations, A:B :: C:D).

In engineering and industrialdesign, this usually means creating a rough, three-di-mensional model—a mockup—with the intention offacilitating feedback and evaluation. However, thephase in which the designer has a sufficiently workedout solution idea that can be physically modeled isa rather late in preliminary design. To get there, thedesigner conducts a search during which intenseidea-generation takes place; many of these ideasconcern partial problems and not necessarily theentire entity that is being targeted. This is the phasein which sketching excels as a yet-unbeatable mode ofrepresentation. Sketching serves the same purpose asprototypes later in the process—feedback and evalu-ation. Unbeatable, because no other mode of repre-sentation—including various digital modes—equalsrapid manual sketching in speed, ﬂexibility, toleranceto inaccuracy, lack of scale and incompletion, andcapability for reversibility and transformation at anymoment."

The alliance betweencognitive psychology, cognitive science, and researchinto the behavior designers exhibit in the processof designing—now a few decades old—is well estab-lished. It is currently expanding further into collabo-ration with what is called embodied cognition, whichis more sensitive to issues regarding feeling, as wellas with neurocognition, which strives to combine thestudy of mind and brain. These are sensible and prom-ising directions of development that will hopefullyshed further light on the processes that occur whiledesigners—be they individuals or teams—generateand shape design ideas. The paper by Lindgaard andWesselius is a nice introduction to some of the diffi-cult questions that face us in making the next steps inthese lines of research. The authors’ recommendationto conduct interdisciplinary research is one that Iembrace wholeheartedly; the seeds have already beensown, and if this paper will give a further push in thisdirection, it will deserve the attention bestowed uponit."

AsI suspected might happen, some of the commenta-tors noticed these. Therefore, to clarify, I am not adesigner—I have only a limited background in designtheory. My background is philosophy and culturalstudies. In practice, I am an interdisciplinary theorist.I engage with theories from multiple ﬁelds with aperspective informed by process philosophy. I haveapplied this to understanding consciousness from anevolutionary and developmental perspective."

To offersome background, my initial research into designthinking—in 2009, when publications were at theirhigh point—left me quite confused and wonderingwhy it had not followed developments in cognitivescience more closely. Later, when developing myunderstanding of the burgeoning ﬁeld of embodiedcognition, it occurred to me that some people whowere familiar with the term design thinking—or hadsimply heard of it—might be interested to know moreabout the developments in cognitive science. Thus,the paper was intended as an introduction to somekey ideas, in a sequence that would be accessible foran audience not familiar with them. I am pleased thatsome commentators—Gabriela Goldschmidt, AlissaAntle, and Kees Dorst—have acknowledged the articleas an introduction, even if they do not necessarilyagree with all of the content."

The organic solvent wasevaporated in a vacuum evaporator and the aqueous fractionwas lyophilized to yield the hexane fraction (FH) (5.70 g), dichlor-omethane fraction (FD) (0.76 g), ethyl acetate fraction (FEAc)(0.44 g) and aqueous fraction (FA) (1.07 g)."

The fractions were ana-lyzed by TLC, affording 24 subfractions. Fraction 20 (0.36 g) waspuriﬁed on a Sephadex LH-20 gel eluted with methanol:chloro-form (1:1) to yield subfractions A (2.1 mg), B (7.4 mg) and C(20.7 mg).

e46,14,46,1,50,376,217,102,354,GulliverRM,7,"Two simple methods have been developed to determine cadmium and lead in different kinds of beveragesand vinegar leached from pewter cups produced in Brazil. Leaching experiments have been carried outwith different solutions: beer, sugar cane spirit, red and white wine, vinegar and a 3% acetic acid solution.The solutions were kept in cups with and without solder for 24 h. Lead and cadmium have been deter-mined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry with deuterium background correction.The limits of detection were 0.05 and 1.4"

With the developed methods it was possible to determine accurately cadmium andlead by direct analysis in these liquids and to evaluate the leaching of these metals from pewter cups. Theresults presented in this work show that pewter cups are not cadmium- and lead-free; this point goesagainst the manufacturers’ declaration that their products are lead-free."

e46,16,54,1,50,537,51,123,251,GulliverRM,7,"Unalloyed tin is too soft to be used for kitchenware, tableware,drinking cups, etc.; hence a small percentage of hardening agents,such as copper, bismuth, antimony and lead are usually added,either alone or in combination, to make it more durable. These tinalloys are known as pewter. Today the composition of pewter fordomestic use is rigidly controlled, based on British and Europeanstandards, specifying a minimum of 90% tin with the balance beingmade up of copper, antimony and perhaps some bismuth. The maindifference from the seventeenth and eighteenth century ordinancesis that the addition of lead is no longer permitted, with the maxi-mum allowed level being 0.5% – in practice usually far less, so thatlead should be present as a trace element only [1]."
e46,17,55,1,50,663,51,49,251,GulliverRM,7,"Pewter was part of everyday’s life until the 19th century. Eat-ing, drinking, celebrating, lighting rooms and taking communionall required long-lasting, affordable objects [1].

Pewter production is a veryimportant source of income for São João del-Rei, a Brazilian citysituated in the state of Minas Gerais, which is one of the majorproduction centers of pewter artifacts in Latin America [2]."
e46,24,65,1,50,558,320,112,251,GulliverRM,7,"It is well known that heavy metals, such as Cd and Pb, aretoxic. The leaching of these elements from pewter cups hence couldrepresent a health hazard. Krachler and Shotyk [3] reported theleaching of relatively high concentrations of Tl and Sb from pocketﬂasks made of pewter. Considering the increasing use of pewterkitchenware in some regions of Brazil, it is of great importanceto evaluate the leaching of potentially toxic metals from theseutensils. In this work, leaching experiments have been carried outwith pewter cups produced in Brazil nowadays, using beer, sugarcane spirit, red and white wine, vinegar and 3% acetic acid as testsolutions."

More recently, the direct determinationof cadmium [12], lead [13] and the simultaneous determinationof cadmium, lead, copper and arsenic [14] in wine samples werereported using palladium or a mixture of palladium and magne-sium nitrates (Pd–Mg) as chemical modiﬁer. All authors found agood correlation between the values obtained by direct determi-nation and by acid digestion. Husáková et al. [15] reported thedirect determination of arsenic in beer by GF AAS using aqueousstandard solutions for calibration and deuterium background cor-rection; the accuracy of the method was conﬁrmed by comparisonwith the results obtained with microwave-assisted digestion andinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Caldaset al. [16–18] determined copper, arsenic and lead in sugar canespirits directly without any sample pretreatment and compared theresults obtained by GF AAS with those found by ICP-MS. Ndung’uet al. [19] observed that the precision for Pb determination in vine-gar improved when using digestion instead of direct analysis. Theauthors also recommended adjusting the graphite furnace temper-ature program taking into consideration the presence of volatileorgano-lead compounds. Cocchi et al. [20] reported low recoveriesfor Cd and Pb, using dry ashing for sample preparation. de Oliveiraet al. [21,22] reported the direct determination of lead in vinegar byGF AAS, using the combination of a permanent modiﬁer and Pd–Mgas conventional modiﬁer. The comparative results and recoveryvalues of spiked samples indicated that no sample treatment wasnecessary to accurately determine Pb in vinegar samples."

Maia, Brazil) were used to evaluatecadmium and lead leaching from pewter cups. The pewter cups ofthree different manufacturers (called A, B and C) were evaluated,originating from the same city, São João del Rei, MG, Brazil. Six cupswith a volume of 30–50 mL without solder and six cups with a vol-ume of 250–300 mL with solder have been purchased from each ofthe manufacturers to investigate the inﬂuence of the solder on themetal migration. The cups were identiﬁed with numbers from 1 to6, each number corresponds to a solution, for example, cup A1 isfrom manufacturer A and was used for acetic acid solution. Beforethe leaching experiments the cups were washed with deionizedwater. A volume of 10 mL for cups without solder, and of 150 mLfor cups with solder, respectively, of each solution was put intothe cups and left in contact at room temperature for 24 h.

e46,58,192,3,1771,2144,51,133,251,GulliverRM,7,"In GF AAS the temperature program is used to separate theanalyte from the concomitants in situ prior to the atomizationstage and the use of chemical modiﬁers is common practice inorder to facilitate the removal of the matrix without loss of volatileanalytes such as cadmium and lead [24]. Our group has investi-gated different chemical modiﬁers for the direct determination oflead [13] in wine samples. It was found that permanent chemi-cal modiﬁers could not stabilize cadmium and lead efﬁciently inwine samples. Moreover, when iridium was used as the permanentmodiﬁer, a double peak was observed for lead in wine samples,similar to the signal obtained without modiﬁer. Based on theseresults, the use of permanent modiﬁers was not considered in thiswork."

Another interesting comparisonis that between 3% acetic acid and vinegar; with only one excep-tion, the extraction of Cd and particularly of Pb are much higher foracetic acid than that due to vinegar, although the acid concentra-tion is comparable. The lead amount leached by acetic acid fromcups without solder are higher than the limit allowed by Brazilianand FDA regulations, which is 500"

e46,145,680,6,4353,4642,40,81,251,GulliverRM,7,Two simple methods to determine cadmium and lead in dif-ferent kind of beverages and vinegar have been developed. Usingthese methods it was possible to determine accurately cadmiumand lead by direct analysis in different liquids and to evaluate theleaching of these metals from pewter cups. The results presentedin this work showed that pewter cups are not cadmium- and lead-free; this point goes against the manufacturers’ declaration thattheir products are lead-free.

e50,16,74,1,50,512,42,91,251,AdvP4DF60E,7,"Quality control methods for medicinal plants are relevantsince modern phytomedicine requires safety and efﬁcacy ofmedicinal plant products for therapeutic use [1]. Besides activecompounds, medicinal plant tissues may contain organic orinorganic hazardous compounds [2]. The determination of toxicmetals such as lead in medicinal plants is relevant due to toxicityrisks of this element and its compounds for human health [3]."
e50,16,75,1,50,512,42,91,251,AdvP4DF60E,7,Trace levels of lead usually found in plant materials require verysensitive and accurate analytical instruments.
e50,17,76,1,50,606,42,70,251,AdvP4DF60E,7,"Among atomic spectrometric techniques for trace analysis, gra-phite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF AAS) is veryattractive due to its capability for direct solid sampling (DSS) [4].The main beneﬁts of DSS are the minimum risk of contamination andanalyte loss, high sensitivity, reduced overall time of analysis, con-sumption of non-hazardous reagents, and the least amount ofwaste [5]."
e50,18,77,1,50,679,42,49,251,AdvP4DF60E,7,"The DSS has been used in GF AAS since the introduction ofgraphite atomizers [6]. However, most published papers related toDSS employed line-source graphite furnace spectrometers [7–9].Moreover, some studies evaluating the use of chemical modiﬁers inthe determination of Pb in different matrices as fuel ethanol [10],"

The optimized heating program of thegraphite tube is listed in Table 2. Although the most sensitiveanalytical line for Pb is at 217.001 nm, all atomic absorptionmeasurements were carried out at 283.306 nm (less sensitive orsecondary line). This line is preferred because it is less interferedby PO molecular structures.

The presence of carbonresidues inside the atomizer conﬁrmed that the pyrolysis stepwould require improvements. In direct solid sampling, chemicalmodiﬁers can reduce matrix effects by (a) modifying the atomiza-tion mechanism of the analyte, often with increased thermalstability, and thus, higher pyrolysis temperatures can be estab-lished without signiﬁcant analyte losses and (b) promoting theextraction of the analyte to the surface of the solid matrix,improving the conditions for atomic cloud generation. Therefore,the conventional chemical modiﬁers Pd(NO"

These may be explained by the low Pb contents for massesin the 0.05–0.2 mg range (8.4–33.4 pg), which are below or close tothe limit of quantiﬁcation (24.1 pg). Additionally, Fig. 3a reveals"
