i16,1258,"Regarding the data used in this research, it is worth noting that to generate the predictive models needed to characterize the main factors that affect users in completing the question-naires, the authors have chosen only those available before the users began the questionnaire. This is because the research is focused on investigating which factors predetermine partici- pants’ success or failure in completing the form, considering all the factors related only to personal context and device and software used to access the web forms. The data aboutthe personal context of the user are provided by the OEEU’s system and include information submitted by the university where the user (graduated) studied. All the information that could be used to create the models that predict whether theuser will complete the questionnaire (before starting it) is pre-sented in Table 1. Table 1 also explains the data variables usedand whether they were valuable for the models. This researchhas been carried out with a total of 7349 users (all whohave some type of experience with the web forms). Of them,the data from 5768 users were considered initially. Finally,data from 3456 users (those resultant after cleaning the data)were used to train and try the machine-learning algorithms(as will be explained in the following section); 1165 userswere the cohort introduced in a phase of reinforcement for the questionnaires that validated the rules generated to adapt the web form to users. This number (1165) includes userswho did not complete the web form in the ﬁrst stage as wellas users that joined the experiment during the reinforcementand validation phase. Other users (416) only viewed the web forms without starting them. For that reason, were notconsidered in the experimental report."

i17,1258,"Yet, the criteria and procedures for selecting the channel access scheme type and measuring the level of congestion on the channel are not speciﬁed in the IEEE 1609.4. The policy of selecting a SCH type and setting up non-overlapping time intervals over the same SCH frequency by the providersare also not clearly deﬁned in the IEEE 1609.4 standard draft. Moreover, according to the legacy standard and other researchers, the SCH communications resource reservation mechanism between service providers and users is imple- mented over the CCH during the ﬁxed CCHI. Consequently, in heavy trafﬁc, safety packets may suffer from severe colli-sions with control packets on the CCH, resulting in unrelia- bility and low PDR of safety applications. Thus, an adaptiveSCH resource reservation mechanism is needed to reducesafety packet collisions over the CCH, and ensure highernetwork throughput of service applications over the SCHs.Typically, the transmission of safety applications in VANETsfollows broadcast mode in which the failed broadcast packetwill never be detected due to the lack of acknowledgementsexchange among vehicles. As a result, the CW size valuefor safety applications remains constant, and accordingly thecollisions of safety packets are increased in heavy networkconditions. For this reason, collision-aware packet transmis- sion mechanism on the CCH is needed providing best initial CW size value according to the network conditions. Thiswill improve time diversity among vehicles, and ensure fewercollisions and higher PDR for safety packet on the CCH."

i25,1258,"Klaedtke et al. [6] proposed an access control program forSDN controller, which is mainly divided into four parts: sep-aration, execution, conﬂict and authorization. Firstly, in orderto distinguish who can access the network and how toaccess it, the various components of the network shouldbe separated logically. Secondly, network users have theirown security requirements for accessing network compo-nents, which means it is necessary for mechanisms to sup-port, express and enforce these requirements. Furthermore,user conﬂicts when sharing network components must beresolved and the authorization to access component shouldbe permitted. Jäger et al. [7] concentrated their work on the environment combining cloud computing with network func-tion virtualization (NFV) /software deﬁned network (SDN)and proposed a multi-level access control system. The basicidea is to limit the executable instruction set of telephonecomponents. And the access control of the application layerand control layer is mainly analyzed."

i27,7612,VI. CONCLUSION
i28,951,"the lfc problem is approached in [6] using the pI-dif-ferential  controller,  which  is  optimized  by  the  lozi  map-based chaotic algorithm. In [7], a differential game-theoryapproach  is  applied  for  the  cooperative  control  of  loadfrequency  in  multiple  areas  by  using  the  conflict  resolu-tion  capability  of  the  algorithm.  a  multiagent  reinforce-ment  learning  approach  is  employed  in  [8]  for  the  lfcproblem in power systems, where the aces are estimatedto tune the controller parameters and improve the controlperformance.  the  authors  in  [9]  used  an  internal  modelcontrol  scheme  with  two  degrees  of  freedom,  in  whicha  reduced-order  model  of  the  system  is  considered  forthe design of a reduced-order lfc system for disturbancerejection. In  [10], a decentralized optimal control schemeis  used  to  solve  the  lfc  problem  in  distributed  power tion, which mitigates the inconsistencies in local estimates.In  most  lfc  techniques  in  the  literature,  either  thecontrol  method  is  nonlinear  (or  linear  time  varying)  orthe  controller  performance  depends  on  communicationlinks  throughout  the  grid.  In  this  article,  the  pI  control-ler structure is selected, which makes the design, stabilityanalysis, and implementation of the controller straightfor-ward due to its simple linear time-invariant structure [11].moreover,  a  classical  descent-direction  Qn-based  optimi-zation technique is applied to simultaneously optimize theperformances  of  all  local  pI  controllers.  the  augmentedconfiguration  of  the  simultaneously  optimized  local  pIcontrollers,  i.e.,  the  optimal  decentralized  pI  controller,does not require any communication among the local con-trollers of the islanded grid."
i28,974,"In an islanded grid in which the synchronous generatorsare  relatively  large  (compared  to  the  other  distributedgeneration systems), the synchronous generators mainlycontrol  the  voltage  and  frequency.  the  lfc  and  auto-matic-voltage-regulator (aVr) systems exist in each syn-chronous generator to compensate for the impact of loadchanges  in  the  frequency  and  voltage  of  the  grid.  themagnitude of these changes are associated with those ofthe  real  (powers,  respectively.however, the dynamics of the two control loops are con-sidered  as  decoupled  because  the  time  constant  of  theprime  mover  (in  lfc)  is  considerably  greater  than  that of  the  excitation  system  (in  an  aVr).  to  this  end,  this article focuses on the lfc loop only, which is importantfor  the  performance  of  the  islanded  grid  when  discon-necting  from  or  connecting  to  the  main  grid  or  whenthe power generated by the other distributed generationsystems  drastically  changes.  therefore,  an  optimal  con-troller  is  needed  to  improve  the  steady-state  and  tran-sient responses of the grid, which is studied in detail inthis article. designing a controller whose performance isrobust to the parameter changes of the system is investi-gated by the authors in [1]."
i28,1263,"the  lfc  problem  has  been  tackled  in  the  literatureby  different  techniques.  In  [2],  the  performance  of  thelfc  loop  is  improved  by  using  a  decentralized  slidingmode control with a pI switching surface. In [3], a decen-tralized  fuzzy-logic-based  scheme  is  used  to  solve  thelfc  problem  in  the  presence  of  high-penetration  windpower,  and  the  particle-swarm  optimization  techniqueis used to calculate the parameters of membership func-tions.  In  [4],  a  direct–indirect  adaptive  fuzzy-controltechnique is used for the lfc control problem of powersystems, in which the unknown parameters of intercon-nected power areas are estimated using adaptive controllaws, and the estimation errors and external disturbanceeffects  are  minimized  using  an H tracking  criteria.

i38,6400,"The second module aims at evaluating the time taken toprogress from one identiﬁed condition to another predictedcondition in a given patient. This uses unidirectional adja-cency matrix representation of the sub-graph to depict pathtraversal from one condition to another. The sub-graphsobtained from our previous analysis are simple unidirec-tional graph segments with no self-loop. This allows us torepresent the sub-graphs as symmetric square matrices withrows (i) and columns (j) deﬁned by graph nodes havinga 0 or 1 value based on whether the entries (conditions) are adjacent or not. In our initial observation we consider that two nodes/conditions can have only one path deﬁnedbetween them, hence the adjacency matrix obtained will haveall 0s on the diagonal [42]. Also, if multiple patients havethe same path traversal between conditions, average time between the progressions are considered. Fig. 8 represents thesub-graph obtained for disease progression from source node Where,"
i38,11422,"In this paper, we discussed the importance of representingpatient social network data as a signiﬁcant contributor forevidence-based healthcare studies in CDSS. Knowledge andontology engineering fundamentals with statistical modelingwere used to predict condition and time of disease pro-gression based on comorbidity behaviors for a sample casestudy considering Brain Aneurysm. The outcomes obtainedfrom our evaluation convey the impact of patient and time relationships in predicting disease progression trends. Our current work is a suggested research approach implying theimportance of knowledge engineering of patient data to inferfuturistic patterns of comorbid progression. This can be fur-ther extended to other speciﬁc healthcare studies as part of future work. We recommend a few areas of enrichment thatcan be applied for our current work."

i44,2021,"III. MOTIVATION Existing CR algorithms do not consider system throughput asa primary criteria while improving the system performance.Resultantly, existing CR algorithms have poor performance interms of system throughput. Moreover, in literature, the pri-mary metrics being used to evaluate the performance of CRalgorithms include delay, energy efﬁciency, scalability, andnode required resources [18], [19]. Among these metrics,the metric that affects the overall system throughput is thedecision making delay. It is either due to the spectrum sensinginterval (i.e., sequentially sensing channels with sam-ples for each) or reporting interval (i.e., sequentially reporting decisions with possible retransmissions). Furthermore,increasing or up to a certain limit leads to a higher delaythan the decision validity interval."

i48,1258,"The data understanding phase of the data mining process involves collecting the data as well as inspecting it closely, which is crucial for the next phase, data preparation. In a dataset, instances represent data entities, which are further characterized by their properties. These properties can alsobe referred to as features or attributes, and they help to understand the characteristics of the data. Feature selection plays a crucial role in the procedure of ‘knowledge discov- ery’ [10]. Generally, a feature selection method evaluates the usefulness of the attributes (i.e., features) present in thedataset; a ranking methodology is considered the optimal way to score such features [11]. A substantial amount of research has been devoted to improving feature selection method-ologies [11]–[15]. However, less attention is given to thedevelopment of a uniﬁed and comprehensive methodologyfor feature ranking. This study proposes an innovative featureranking methodology called Uniﬁed Features Scoring (UFS).The primary ambition of UFS is to evaluate the feature set ina comprehensive manner dependent on several different fea-ture selection measures, namely information gain (IG), gainratio (GR), symmetric uncertainty (SU), chi-square (CS), andsigniﬁcance [12], [16]–[18]. UFS is a consensus methodol-ogy that assists the domain expert in selecting informative features for the data preparation phase of CRISP-DM."
