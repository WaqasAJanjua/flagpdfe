a13,1839,"Secondly, we adapt the CF approach to personalized POI recommendation with aranking-based matrix factorization technique. Due to the lack of explicit preferenceratings on POIs, we leverage the number of a user’s uploaded or favored photos fora POI as a proxy to quantify his/her preference degree on that POI. The underlyingassumption is that a high uploading or favoring frequency can be interpreted in away that a user repeatedly conﬁrms his/her preference [Wang et al. 2014; Shi et al.2013]. Several prior efforts focus on approximating the observed preference scores [Shiet al. 2013; Phan et al. 2014]. In practice, however, users do not care about the speciﬁcscores, but about a compact recommendation list of POIs. Inspired by this, we proposeto generate the relative ranking of users’ preferences on POIs. The matrix factorizationtechnique is applied to learn latent factors of users and POIs from a large number ofpairwise preference relations with varying degrees of importance, which are inducedvia the comparison of two POIs. It is worth noting that, in our approach, both POIswith and without observed preference mutually reinforce the learning process, whichhelps further reduce the effects of data sparseness."

Another example is the aforementioned leakage of sensitiveinformation over various side channels that exist between physically co-located VMs,which has partially resulted in a number of CSPs offering dedicated VM instances fora small premium."

a27,7194,"In other words, Theorem 4.3 states that the independent subgraph approach is the manner in which a lossless indexing system can be obtained for a probabilisticgraph, at least for undirected graphs. The case of directed graphs is more complex;the tools that we use (in particular, tree decompositions) are more robust and betterunderstood in the setting of undirected graphs [Robertson and Seymour 1984] than inthat of directed ones [Safari 2005]. For that reason, we leave open the possibility ofusing techniques that exploit directedness of edges to obtain better indexing systems,in the case of directed graphs, than techniques based on the independent subgraphapproach."

a27,20536,"The space overhead of I (Figure 8) is also reasonable. Generally, the ProbTree forFWD w (cid:2) 2 and SPQR only incurs between 10% (W ) and double (N ) space overheadcompared to the space cost of the original graph. As expected, the LIN decompositionsfor the road networks increase signiﬁcantly in size compared to their original graphsize, even reaching a few gigabytes in the case of C and E , and up to 10 timesin the size of the original graph in the case of E . Since the higher widths of thetree decompositions no longer retain the linear size increase property, that is, canbe quadratic in the original size, this is not surprising. Nevertheless, the query timesavings of the lossless decompositions of E , N , and C are very important, as weshall see next."

On the other hand, VMs that belong to the same application may exhibitcorrelation between their loads, increasing the probability that they will peak at the same time; this also has to be considered carefully in the VM allocation [Verma et al.2009]."

On the one hand, (1) initial placement and (2) placementreoptimization must be differentiated: the former determines a placement for a newset of VMs, whereas the latter optimizes an existing placement. (The key difference isthat placement reoptimization must use migrations, which is not necessary for initial placement.) On the other hand, based on the set of VMs for which the placement isdetermined, the following three different levels can be distinguished: (1) all VMs of theCP, (2) a set of coupled VMs (e.g., the VMs implementing a given service), or (3) a singleVM. Since these are two independent dimensions, we get six possible placement tasks;all of them are meaningful, although some are rather rare (e.g., initial placement ofall VMs occurs only when a new DC starts its operation).

Both of these approaches use DTW as distance measure, but -DBA alsomodiﬁes its centroid computation method. This modiﬁcation signiﬁcantly improvesthe performance of #NAME? -AVG+DTW, with an average improvementin the Rand Index of 19%. Despite this improvement, #NAME? -AVG+ED in a statistical signiﬁcant manner. Another algorithm thatmodiﬁes both the distance measure and the centroid computation method of #NAME? -DBA, KSC is signiﬁcantly worse than -AVG+ED. We note thatthis ﬁnding contradicts our previous analysis on a subset of 48 datasets [Paparrizosand Gravano 2015], where -AVG+ED was shown to perform better in 54% of thedatasets but not in a statistically signiﬁcant manner. Our current analysis is based onalmost twice as many datasets as our analysis in Paparrizos and Gravano [2015], whichprovides substantially more evidence to the Wilcoxon test. (The -value for Wilcoxonwas very close to the conﬁdence level in Paparrizos and Gravano [2015], which resultedin considering the difference in accuracy of -AVG+ED and KSC negligible.)"

Feller and Fitzgerald [2002, p. 84] characterized peer review in open-source settings as ; that is, peer-review in open-source projects is a self-selected task by other interested developers [Asundi and Jayvant 2007; Rigby et al.2008].

Taking simple meta-data into account alone for the candidate set generation, such as the minimal and maximum valueof each column or the data type, still would lead to a vast amount of candidates to check. Ouralgorithm does not explicitly enumerate all ind candidates and thus keeps the initial candidate setof inds to check small. Instead, we create bit-signatures for each of the columns in the input thatact as fingerprints. Those fingerprints must fulfill one important criterion: If the value set of onecolumn A in an instance of R is a subset of another column B in R (ind R . A ⊆ R . B holds), thebit-signature of A shall also be a subset of the bit-signature of B . Similar hashing approaches arealready known as simhash (Charikar 2002)."

a47,8285,"We are motivated to use EHR data for the early detection of mental health disorders,considering its wide accessibility and standardized use in primary care settings. Fur-ther, we are especially interested in identifying those high-risk students who have notyet received diagnosis or treatment for a mental health disorder. We thus design ourexperiments as follows."
