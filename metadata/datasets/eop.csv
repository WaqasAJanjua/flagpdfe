Thus, a direct relation betweenshareholder wealth and proxy contests has been demonstrated(DeAngelo & DeAngelo, 1989; Dodd & Warner, 1983; Mulherin &Poulsen, 1998), with palpable consequences observable through-out ﬁnancial markets (Becker et al., 2013; Fischer et al., 2009). Inaddition, although there is a lack of consensus regarding the crite-ria that proxy advisors take into account in order to disclose theirvoting advise (Choi et al., 2008), they tend to acclaim a non-pro votewhen a company with low results discloses high executive compen-sation (Ertimur, Ferri, & Oesch, 2013), with a demonstrated directrelation between the application of the Say on Pay policy and cor-porate performance (Cu ˜nat, Gine, & Guadalupe, 2013), and someempirical ﬁndings on how corporate governance is linked to votedirection (Cai, Garner, & Walkling, 2009). Moreover, the damagesderived from reputational risk have been explored through votingbehavior, with voting pattern suggested as an adequate indicatorfor reputational harm (Bernile & Jarrell, 2009; Ertimur et al., 2012;Ferri & Maber, 2013).",e11

As a matterof fact, corporate reputation has been referred as a strong com-petitive advantage for ﬁnancial institutions (Xifra & Ordeix, 2009)and reputational risk has been identiﬁed as a severe threat for thebanking business (Limentani & Tresoldi, 1998).",e11

Infact, the United States banking industry is a particularly motivatingfocus for investigation, considering that the deregulation processthat has been affecting this sector in recent times makes it anadequate choice for addressing the corporate consequences of envi-ronmental changes (Berger, Kashyap, Scalise, Gertler, & Friedman,1995; Calomiris, 2000; Lounsbury, Hirsch, & Klinkerman, 1998;Marquis & Lounsbury, 2007).",e11

For each bank and year in oursample, we count the pro votes and the non-pro votes regarding the corporate performance during that year.The non-pro votes include both abstains and against votes, since this is a common practice in the governanceindustry (Gregory-Smith & Main, 2013). If the pro votes overcome the non-pro votes, we give the class“sustain” for that bank and year. In other case, we assign the class “not sustain”.We calculate the total number of funds disclosing at least one vote for each bank and year.This variable shows the natural log of the total volume of assets for each bank and year.We calculate the number of years lapsed since the date of the ﬁrst corporate meeting of a given bank collectedin ProxyDemocracy.For each bank and year, we compute this ratio by relating operating proﬁt to total assets.For each bank and year, we calculate the inter-annual growth of the operating income.For each bank and year, we compute this ratio by relating the book value of liabilities to the book value ofequity.For each bank and year, we relate the amount of dividends paid to the market capitalization.For each bank and year, we compute this ratio by relating the operating proﬁt to the operating income.For each bank and year, we relate the market value of assets to the book value of assets.

RELATED WORK Anomaly detection, or outlier detection, is an activity for finding the patterns in dataset which do not conform to the expected pattern or deviates from the expected behavior greatly. Anomaly detection is of great significance in many applications and there are many different methods available for outlier detection so far. In general, anomaly detection method can be categorized as distance-based method [Angiulli",e12

RELATED WORK Anomaly detection, or outlier detection, is an activity for finding the patterns in dataset which do not conform to the expected pattern or deviates from the expected behavior greatly. Anomaly detection is of great significance in many applications and there are many different methods available for outlier detection so far. In general, anomaly detection method can be categorized as distance-based method [Angiulli",e12

The methodinvolves a sequential application of a constant current between the platinum (cathode) and silver(anode) electrodes, followed by measuring the potential of the combination pH electrode, using anisopropanol/water mixture as solvent and LiCl as the supporting electrolyte. A preliminary evaluation ofthe new method, using acetic acid for doping a biodiesel sample, showed an average recovery of 100.1%.Compared to a volumetric titration-based method for determining the AN of several biodiesel samples(ranging from about 0.18 to 0.95 mg g",e13

Thus, the use of ethanol and biodiesel asalternative energy sources has increased, also having been inﬂu-enced by a variety of political, economic, and social factors [1–4].Biodiesel is basically composed of fatty acid alkyl esters, whichare obtained by the transesteriﬁcation of vegetable oils or animalfats, using a short-chain alcohol such as methanol or ethanol.

1,328,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,AB,"Memory based algorithms, often referred to as similarity based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular andsuccessful approaches to provide service recommendations. It provides automated and personalized suggestions to consumers toselect variety of products. Typically, the core of similarity based CF which greatly affect the performance of recommendationsystem is to ﬁnding similar users to a target user. Conventional similarity measures like Cosine, Pearson correlation coefﬁcient,Jaccard similarity suffer from accuracy problem under sparse environment. Hence in this paper, we propose a new similarityapproach based on Mean Measure of Divergence that takes rating habits of a user into account. The quality of recommendation ofproposed approach is analyzed on benchmark datasets: ML 100 K, ML-1 M and Each Movie for various sparsity levels. The resultsdepict that the proposed similarity measure outperforms existing measures in terms of prediction accuracy.© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",e14

Reaction of 3-chloropropylsiloxysilica with pyridine yields apyridinium substitution [5]. The anion exchange properties of a sil-ica gel surface modiﬁed with covalently bound pyridinium saltswere ﬁrst described by Tundo et al. for application as a catalyst [6].Later the exchange kinetics and selectivity of several anions usingsilica functionalized with the pyridinium ion were studied and thismaterial was used as a support in the adsorption of metallic ionsfrom aqueous and non-aqueous solutions [5,7–10].

El CA se reﬁere al vínculo emocional, laidentiﬁcación e involucración del empleado con la organización,resultado de los valores e intereses compartidos (Meyer y Allen,1991). Mientras que el compromiso de continuidad se basa enel reconocimiento del coste asociado con abandonar la organiza-ción, el compromiso normativo reﬂeja el sentimiento de obligaciónde continuar con la relación laboral (Meyer y Allen, 1991). Sinembargo, se ha cuestionado la consideración del compromiso decontinuidad como una dimensión del compromiso organizativo, yla relación entre las dimensiones afectiva y normativa. El metaaná-lisis de Meyer, Stanley, Herscovitch y Topolnytsky (2002) encontróun coeﬁciente de correlación corregido de tan solo 0,05 entre elCA y el compromiso de continuidad. Algunos autores han sugeridoque la fuerte correlación hallada entre CA y compromiso normativo(0,63) diﬁculta separar ambas dimensiones desde el punto de vistaempírico (Lee y Chulguen, 2005). Según Solinger, van Olffen y Roe(2008, p. 74), el CA es una actitud hacia la organización, mientrasque el compromiso normativo y el de continuidad son actitudeshacia comportamientos especíﬁcos de permanecer o abandonarla organización.

Se necesitanestudios longitudinales que apoyen la causalidad de estas rela-ciones. Segundo, todos los datos proceden de la misma fuente:los propios empleados. Aunque el sesgo del método común raravez es suﬁcientemente grave como hacer peligrar la validez de losresultados (Spector, 2006), para intentar reducirlo se siguieron lasrecomendaciones de Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee y Podsakoff (2003)relativas al dise ˜no del cuestionario. Futuros estudios podrían consi-derar las percepciones de los supervisores o compa ˜neros al evaluarel CA o las características del puesto.

5,3752,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,BODY,"Task allocation in DAI-enabled heterogeneous MAS is challenging because each agent has incomplete informationto rationally determine which agent takes which task. Considering only an organization view says that it is better toallocate tasks to the best-capable agent as much as possible in order to maximize their beneﬁt. This study proposeda CPU scheduling-based algorithm to allow agents to perform rational decision for the organization. Because thestructure of whether or not they take a task is similar with CPU scheduling that has multiple cores (i.e., agents), webelieve that more advanced scheduling theories and algorithms, e.g., Round Robin, can be applied to solve the taskallocation problem.",e19

In the basiccircular no. 118, the BDL puts the guidelines for the establishment of theaudit  committee  according  to  certain  characteristics  (size,  independence,frequency  of  meeting  and  financial  literacy  of  members),  thus  ensuringthe  good  practices  of  corporate  governance.  The  audit  committeeeffectiveness depends on the prosperity or financial distress of companies,such  as  financially  literate  audit  committee  members  increase  thecompany  performance  and  prevent  its  financial  distress  [6],  [7].  Thisevidence  of  competence  between  members  enhances  companyperformance and reduces the likelihood of  financial problems. Moreover,it  is  expected  that  the  domination  of  non-executive  members,  helps  thecompany  to  enhance  its performance  and  to avoid  any  financial distress.[8]  found  that  effective  audit  committee  could  increase  the  financialstatement  credibility  and  objectivity.

During thisperiod,  four  banks  became  insolvent  and  eleven  had  to  resort  to  CentralBank lending [10]. Moreover, in this paper, audit committee performanceis  studied  by  showing  the  audit  committee  characteristic  relation  withfinancially  and  non-distressed  banks.  For  the  purpose  of  this  paper,financially distressed banks consist of those under profitability problems.The financially non-distressed banks are the ones with a significant rate ofprofitability. It is expected that audit committee with good characteristicsis negatively related to the financial distress of the bank. The performanceof  Lebanese  bank  sector  has  previously  been  examined  in  term  ofgovernance practices [11]. The paper used the impact of outside directorson  bank  performance  without  taking  into  consideration  audit  committeeeffectiveness.  However,  this  paper  goes  beyond  comparing  the  bankprofitability  among  distressed  and  non-distressed  banks.  It  examines  therelationship  between  the  characteristics  of  audit  committee  and  thefinancial distress of these banks. In addition, it examines audit committeeeffectiveness taking into consideration their role, their objective and theirresponsibility  to  provide  bank  prosperity.  This  is  essential  to  focus  onevaluating committee effectiveness to avoid financial distress.The  establishment decision  of  audit committee  was  adopted  in  2008  andwas modified in 2010 in Lebanese banks.

According to agency theory, aconflict  exists  between  shareholders  and  managers.  Therefore,  the  topmanagement may take some decisions which are not for the best interestof shareholders [13]. In this context, there is an asymmetry of informationbetween these two poles. The separation of decision management helps tocontrol this asymmetry by limiting the power of the agent and preventingthe deviation of shareholders interest [14]. Hence, the agency costs factors[12].  Thisshouldeffectiveness is used to reduce such conflict  [15].

There  is  evidence  that  more  independent  auditcommittees are seeking to preserve the independence of the external auditprocess.  The  participation  of  non-executive  members  in  large  proportionimproves  the  audit  committee  independence.  This  enhancement  of  auditcommittee independence should facilitate decision and assure informationobjectivity [27]. For this reason, the audit committee should maintain themonitoring  role  delegated  by  the  board  with  aim  to  provide  betterreliability  of  information.  Consequently,  the  presence  of  independentboard committees increases the capacity of corporate boards to effectivelyadvise, monitor and discipline top management [28].Non-executive directors are considered to be an important mechanism inensuring  corporate  accountability  [29],  [30].  Fully  independent  auditcommittee  (non-executives  members)  is  associated  to  outcomes,  andexpected to improve governance with more effective committee [31]. Thisclearly  evidences  that  large  proportion  of  independent  members  in  auditcommittee  ensures  the  effectiveness  of  strategic  management  decision-making.  In  the  same  way,  [32]  observe  that  an  audit  committee  shouldcomprise a higher proportion of non-executive directors. [31] observe thatfull-independent  audit  committee  provides  a  better  monitoring  ofmanagement  than  the  existence  of  executive  members  with  objectivedecision.

An active audit committeehas a significant impact on the financial performance of the banks. Hence,audit  committee  effectiveness  optimizes  banks  level  performance  beingimportant  keys  in  corporate  governance.  The  effective  audit  committeehelps  management  to  enhance  bank  performance.  This  paper  examinesaudit  committee  characteristics  of  Lebanese  bank  sector  in  relation  tofinancial distress.Findings of this paper show that financial distress is significantly relatedwith  the  meeting  frequency  of  audit  committee  members.  Results  showthat  frequent  meetings  of the audit committee  are  able  to  enhance  banksperformance. Hence, the audit committee with frequent meetings is able tohelp  audit  committee  members  to  fulfill  their  responsibilities.  In  otherwords,  audit  committee  is  able  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  financialreporting,  to  provide  better  monitoring  and  to  review  effectively  theoperations.  However,  the  unavailability  of  individuals  to  hold  highfrequency of meeting poses a problem to the audit committee in order tofulfill  their  responsibility.  In  Lebanese  banks,  our  finding  suggests  thataudit  committees  in  22  of  149  bank  year  of  data  do  not  hold  regularmeetings  per  year.

To  comply  with  the  BDLrequirement, the audit committee members should be available minimumonce a quarter.Results indicate that there is no significant relationship between financialdistress  and the  other  three  independent  variables;  size,  composition  andfinancial literacy of an audit committee. Hence, on average, the Lebanesebanks  meet  the  minimum  requirements  of  BDL  in  terms  of  size,composition  and  financial  literacy.  This  is  clear  evidence  that  Lebanesebanks comply with regulation to prevent any punitive action taken by theBDL  and  BCCL.  However,  complying  with  these  requirements  is  notenough  to  enhance  banks  performance.  Other  qualitative  factors  haveinfluence  on  audit  committee  performance  [6]  such  as  quality  ofdiscussion  during  meetings,  level  of  commitment  of  audit  committeemembers and organizational work environment.Hence, our findings support the previous studies which have examined therelation  between  audit  committee  characteristics  and  financial  distressparticularly  size,  independence,  meeting  frequency  and  financial  literacy[6],  [7].

Moststudies on economic impact of sporting events focus on mega events or look for an impact in medium tolarge size cities. This study estimates the effect of a two-day event, the Rally Ourense, that takes placein a small town in Spain. Economic impact is estimated based on surveys of spectators and interviewsof competitors in the 2009, 2010, and 2011 editions of the rally. The results show that the race hasfavorable effects, but also suggest that the impact could be increased with some simple changes to theevent structure.",e23

Second, whileit is a small event, it is part of a national competition attractingspectators and competitors from outside the area.

The race takes place in branches of roads distant fromthe populated areas. The spectators have to arrive mostly by carto the zones enabled to attend the pass of the competing vehicles.So, an accurate estimation can be done measuring the length of theroads with parked cars in every access to the tranches. Then thenumber of cars can be estimated considering the average length ofa vehicle. Asking the questionnaire about the number of occupantsin the respondent’s cars and multiplying the average occupancyobtained by the estimated number of cars produces an approxi-mate number of spectators for each tranche. Unfortunately, simplyadding together the number of spectators at each tranche couldresult in double, or multiple counting of a single spectator, as anindividual can attend the race in different tranches. Spectators mayview a tranche of the race, then drive off to another location to seeanother tranche. If that person viewed several tranches, he couldbe counted many times in the attendance ﬁgure. For that reason,the survey includes a question asking about the tranches the indi-vidual plans to visit. To avoid this double counting of visitors, wemultiply the total number of attendees by a coefﬁcient that is theratio of the number of non-locals that responded to the survey tothe total number of tranches that they indicated they were goingto visit.

In the US setting,institutional investors are more likely than individual investors to prefer dividends over capital gains. In fact, as long as insti-tutional investors and individual investors differ in their tax preferences for dividends versus capital gains, they can trade ina certain fashion to reduce their tax burdens and therefore drive up trading volume. The intuition is rather simple. When thelevel of institutional ownership is relatively low, tax induced tax heterogeneity is low (everyone is an individual investor)and trading volume will be low. When the level of institutional ownership is relatively high, tax induced heterogeneity isagain low (everyone is an institutional investor) and trading volume will be low. When the level of institutional ownershipis in between these extremes, tax induced heterogeneity is high (a combination of individual and institutional investors) andtrading volume will be high. Therefore, trading volume is an increasing and concave function of institutional ownership(Dhaliwal and Li, 2006) as reﬂected in the following equation:",e28

CRM implementa-tion can be undertaken in different forms (Gupta & Pirsch, 2006a;Liu & Ko, 2011). One of the most common forms involves the dona-tion of a portion of the corporation’s proﬁts from each productsold to a cause. In this sense, CRM is deﬁned by Varadarajan andMenon (1988, p. 60) as “the process of formulating and implemen-ting marketing activities that are characterized by an offer fromthe ﬁrm to contribute a speciﬁed amount to a designated causewhen customers engage in revenue-providing exchanges that sat-isfy organizational and individual objectives”.",e29

Forinstance, cause marketing programmes allow companies to createa link with customers and show a commitment to social respon-sibility. Unlike other marketing communications tools, CRM isalso a powerful way to reach consumers on an emotional level(Roy, 2010). This promotional strategy can improve and sustain afavourable image and reputation among consumers, establish dif-ferentiation from competitors and add value to the brand (Brown &Dacin, 1997; Wymer & Samu, 2009). All these beneﬁts can, in sum,positively inﬂuence consumer attitude and purchase behaviour.However, recent research has shown that, compared to other cor-porate social responsibility (CSR) actions, such as sponsorship orphilanthropy, CRM activities are more likely to be viewed with sus-picion (Lii & Lee, 2012; Sheikh & Beise-Zee, 2011), as CRM initiativesgenerally require consumers to make a purchase; therefore, the linkbetween the cause and the company’s proﬁts can result in a lessfavourable evaluation.",e29

The evaluation of CRM initiatives is likelyto depend on the type of product used (i.e. hedonic vs. utilitarian)(Strahilevitz & Myers, 1998). Likewise, perceived ﬁt, which refersto the degree of proximity or congruence between the product andthe cause, has been assumed to be one of the most inﬂuential withrespect to the ultimate success of the partnership (Lafferty, 2007).Controversy exists, however, regarding the inﬂuence of these vari-ables. For instance, while some authors have found that consumerresponse to CRM is more favourable when the products are hedonicrather that utilitarian (Strahilevitz & Myers, 1998), others have notreplicated these results (Subrahmanyan, 2004; Wymer & Samu,2009). Likewise, advice on the level of ﬁt between the productand the cause is mixed, with some calling for a high level of ﬁtand others advocating a moderate or low product-cause ﬁt level(Barone et al., 2000). In addition, both factors (the type of prod-uct and perceived ﬁt) can simultaneously inﬂuence three levelsof consumer response: cognitive, affective and behavioural (Roy,2010).

Forinstance, Strahilevitz and Myers (1998) found that donations tocharity were more effective for promoting frivolous products (i.e.hedonic products) than in promoting practical products (i.e. util-itarian products). On the contrary, monetary incentives (i.e. pricediscounts) were preferred when they were bundled with utilitar-ian or practical products. This result can be explained by the factthat hedonic products are more likely than utilitarian products toarouse both pleasure and guilt (Kivetz & Simonson, 2002; Zheng &Kivetz, 2009). According to the ﬁeld of social psychology, guilt is anegative emotion that a person may wish to overcome by means ofsome prosocial behaviour (e.g. Batson & Coke, 1981). Therefore, thefeeling of guilt can be mitigated if the hedonic purchase is linkedto a cause. In contrast, CRM campaigns linked to practical productstend to generate fewer emotional responses. Thus, the evaluationand purchase decisions for these types of products are usually morerational and focused on cues related to the product itself (Chang,2008).",e29

Product-category is considered a functional ﬁt and it isdetermined in function of the characteristics, attributes and func-tions of the type of product of the brand and the type of social causesupported. Brand-name ﬁt refers to how comfortable consumersare with the cause-brand pairing and it is related with the congru-ence between the image of the brand and the social cause.

Speciﬁcally, some studies have found that high perceived ﬁtcan negatively inﬂuence consumers’ brand perceptions. This neg-ative effect is due to the fact that CRM campaigns with high ﬁtcan be viewed by consumers as opportunistic (Drumwright, 1996;Ellen, Mohr, & Webb, 2000). However, most works have revealedthe opposite. In general, high ﬁt has been proven to positively affectdifferent factors, such as product choice (Pracejus & Olsen, 2004;Strahilevitz & Myers, 1998), attitude towards the brand (Bigné-Alca ˜niz, Currás-Pérez, & Sánchez-García, 2009; Samu & Wymer,2009), and attitude towards the campaign (Barone et al., 2000).As such, higher levels of perceived ﬁt between the product andthe cause will lead consumers to perceive the company as beingmore expert, and favour the transfer of positive feelings and beliefsabout the cause to the brand (Ellen, Webb, & Mohr, 2006; Hoefﬂer& Keller, 2002). Likewise, a high ﬁt can explain why an organiza-tion is supporting a cause (Sheikh & Beise-Zee, 2011). Therefore,it is suggested that higher levels of ﬁt will improve the credibilityof the association between the company and the cause, as well asthe consumers’ attitudes and purchase intentions (Gupta & Pirsch,2006b; Pracejus & Olsen, 2004; Samu & Wymer, 2009). In contrast,lower levels of ﬁt are likely to generate weaker attributions of thebrand’s motive and perceptions of brand credibility, and lead tonegative attitudes towards the brand (Becker-Olsen, Cudmore, &Hill, 2006; Rifon, Choi, Trimble, & Li, 2004).

Incontrast, despite the fact that some studies have suggested thatCRM used in hedonic products should enhance purchase inten-tion, this was not the case in this study. Previous literature suggeststhat the feeling of guilt evoked by the purchase of hedonic prod-ucts can be tempered when the hedonic purchase is linked to acause (Strahilevitz & Myers, 1998). However, in our study, con-trary to what was expected, CRM linked to utilitarian (vs. hedonic)products lead to higher purchase intention. This ﬁnding is consis-tent with other recent studies (Roy, 2010; Subrahmanyan, 2004).The experiential beneﬁts generated by the cause may explain thisﬁnding. CRM campaigns generate emotional arousal and affectivebeneﬁts. The addition of these beneﬁts to the expected func-tional beneﬁts of the utilitarian products may enhance their overallperceived value (Lim & Ang, 2008) and, consequently, their pur-chase intentions. Further, the consumption of utilitarian productsis typically rational, cognitively driven and goal oriented (Roy &Ng, 2012). These characteristics may make consumers more awareof the need to help causes, thereby increasing their purchaseintentions.",e29

Perceived ﬁt had a signiﬁcant effect on both thecredibility of the campaign and the attitude towards the brand.In contrast, a high level of ﬁt did not have any signiﬁcant effecton purchase intention. Extant literature has widely discussed theinﬂuence of the perceived ﬁt between the product and the causeon consumer response. Although most researchers advocate a highproduct-cause ﬁt level, others call for a moderate or low level of ﬁt(Drumwright, 1996). Several researchers have not supported thathigher levels of ﬁt can improve consumer responses to CRM cam-paigns (e.g. Lafferty, 2007; Nan & Heo, 2007). Our results showthat ﬁt has a signiﬁcant effect on both the cognitive and affec-tive level of the consumer response. When consumers perceive ahigh ﬁt, the campaign is more credible. In addition, the beliefs andaffect associated with the cause might be transferred to the brand,thus improving consumers’ perceptions towards it. The ﬁndings inthis study suggest that perceived ﬁt between the product and thecause, in contrast, does not play a key role in terms of inﬂuencingthe behavioural level of the consumer response. As Lafferty (2007)explains, other variables, such as the congruence among the indi-viduals and the ﬁrm, can inﬂuence the purchase intent. Therefore,two CRM campaigns with different levels of ﬁt could get similareffects.",e29

The cognitive response was notaffected by this factor. Therefore, the nature of the product doesnot appear to be a relevant determinant of the credibility of thecampaign. In contrast, while the affective response, measuredthrough the brand attitude, was higher for hedonic products, thebehavioural response, measured through purchase intentions, wasslightly higher for utilitarian products. These mixed results couldsuggest that CRM campaigns are not only suitable for hedonic prod-ucts, as has usually been proposed in the literature, but also forutilitarian products. Indeed, our ﬁndings show that linking a CRMcampaign to a utilitarian product may be more effective in inﬂu-encing purchase intentions. Therefore, marketers selling hedonicproducts can beneﬁt from a more favourable attitude towards theirbrands, whereas marketers selling utilitarian products can beneﬁtfrom higher purchase intentions.",e29

A high level of ﬁt did not have any signiﬁcant effect on pur-chase intention. It is interesting to note, however, that according tothe results of our study, a CRM campaign with high product-causeﬁt, compared with one of low ﬁt, is more effective in inﬂuenc-ing the credibility of the campaign and the attitude towards thebrand. Therefore, the perceived ﬁt between the cause and theproduct does appear to be relevant. As such, marketing managersshould acknowledge the importance of linking their products withcongruent causes. Some consumers are sceptical about the ﬁrms’objectives when using CRM alliances. Therefore, higher ﬁt canreduce this scepticism and increase the credibility of the campaign.Similarly, as most managers seek to maintain and reinforce positiveattitude towards their brands, linking their brands to CRM initia-tives appears to be a wise alternative to reach this objective andbuild consumer-based brand equity. The selection of the cause is,therefore, extremely important when designing these initiatives.",e29

The combination of fractional factorial design and Desirability functionwas used to evaluate the ICP OES operational parameters and the regression models using CentralComposite and Doehlert designs were calculated to stablish the best working condition for all analytes.Seventeen lipstick samples manufactured in different countries with different colors and brands wereanalyzed. Some samples contained high concentrations of toxic elements, such as Cr and Pb, which arecarcinogenic and cause allergic and eczematous dermatitis. The maximum concentration detected washigher than the permissible safe limits for human use, and the samples containing these high metalconcentrations were intended for use by children. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as achemometrics tool for exploratory analysis to observe the similarities between samples relative to themetal concentrations (a correlation between Cd and Pb was observed).",e31

Six procedures forthe analysis of different sets of CHOs present in six food matrices were developed. The effects of pH,electrolyte and surfactant concentrations on the separation of the compounds were investigated usinga central composite design requiring 17 experiments. The simultaneous optimization of the responsesfor separation of six sets of CHOs was performed employing empirical models for prediction of optimalresolution conditions in six matrices, condensed milk, orange juices, rice bran, red wine, roasted andground coffee and breakfast cereal samples. The results indicate good separation for the samples, withappropriate detectability and selectivity, short analysis time, low reagent cost and little waste generation,demonstrating that the proposed technique is a viable alternative for carbohydrate analysis in foods.",e32

1,517,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,HF,"The analysis of carbohydrates in foods has extreme nutritionalimportance since they contribute with 40–50% of the caloric intakeof human beings [1]. The constant increase in obesity indices, dia-betes and some CHO intolerances intensify the necessity of theirrigorous control. In the food industry, they are used as technolog-ical coadjuvants in order to obtain physicochemical and sensorialcharacteristics of foods [2,3], but they also serve as quality markersduring processing [4]. Milk, when subjected to excessive heating,suffers a lactose isomerization reaction forming lactulose and epi-lactose. Both have ssmaller biological values than lactose and maycause negative effects like ﬂatulence [4–7]. The presence of anexcessive amount of glucose in ground coffee after hydrolysis indi-cates product adulteration from the addition of other grains [8]. Inrice bran, a food industry by-product, xylose is the predominantcarbohydrate, which has been used as a source for obtaining xyl-itol (a compound with high sweetening power) [9]. In wines, thequantiﬁcation of CHOs is correlated with ﬁnal product conserva-tion. Studies indicate that the majority of microorganisms used forthe fermentation process consume more glucose than fructose. So,high contents of fructose in wine can compromise its preservation",e32

Several analytical tech-niques have been studied for this purpose, among them highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary elec-trophoresis (CE). CE is an ascending technique for this type ofanalysis, since the fused-silica capillary withstands highly alkalinepHs, above 11.5, allowing the ionization of CHOs, which facilitatesseparation [14–21]. Besides this, the technique has been largelyemployed owing to its low reagent consumption and waste gen-eration [14,22–26]. Various kinds of separations have already beenstudied with CE, emphasizing capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE),with or without derivatization reactions, and micellar electroki-netic chromatography (MEKC) with cationic surfactant [14–21].Despite several investigations developed to separate CHOs in foodmatrices, one can still verify some separations difﬁculties still exist,mainly between maltose and glucose [14], glucose and galactose[22], galactose, maltose and maltotriose [23], fructose and xylose[24] and fructose and mannose [8], separations that are very impor-tant for the food industry. The MEKC with anionic surfactant is atype of separation employed in several food analyses and is basedon analyte partition into two phases, the micellar phase and the runelectrolyte. The formation of micelles occurs by the addition of sur-factant agents to the electrolyte, in concentrations above the criticalmicellar concentration [27]. Bao et al. [28] observed good results",e32

Multivariate optimizationstrategies have been increasingly and efﬁciently used for devel-oping and optimizing separation methods, since they allow theevaluation of interaction effects among the variables, reduce thenumber of experiments and make possible the construction ofempirical models to predict the most adequate experimental condi-tions [20,29]. On the other hand, optimization of the simultaneousseparation of several compounds involves a large number ofresponses, each of which may have different optimal regions withinthe experimental domain. The Derringer and Suich method [30],which is suitable for optimizing several responses, is based onthe construction of a global desirability function involving all theresponses of the system. Recently the central composite design [31]and the Derringer and Suich method have been successfully utilizedin several works like the studies of the separation of resveratrol innutraceuticals [32], rizatriptan in medical drugs [33], separation ofchiral compounds [34], optimization of biochemical experiments[35] and separation of phenolic compounds from extra-virgin oliveoil [36].",e32

For many climate-inﬂuenced decisions,prediction times of months to a decade are likely to be the most important. Making predictions with such lead times largelyrelies on the existence of relatively slow, and hence predictable, variations in quantities such as the moisture in the soil,snow cover, sea-ice and ocean temperatures (Shukla and Kinter, 2006), and how the atmosphere interacts with and isaffected by these conditions. In addition, the observed evolution of temperature and other climate variables at the seasonaland longer timescales can also be considered as externally forced low-frequency variability due to human-induced changesin greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol concentrations, land-use changes as well as natural variations in solar activity and vol-canic eruptions, superimposed on the natural variability of the system.",e33

Despite the importance ofwriting skills, they do not seem to receive sufﬁcient atten-tion from management researchers, and poor writing and pre-sentation remains one of the most prevalent problems inmanuscripts submitted to management journals (Bettis &Penberra, 1989; Billsberry, 2014; Daft, 1995; Fischer, 1992;Thompson, 1981). The manuscript may be addressing an in-teresting idea but the basic writing problem is too distract-ing to allow the reviewers to focus on the content of themanuscript.

1,322,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,AB,"Design thinking is, for many, a poor name for a serious process. It is a short-hand term for an iterative problem-solving process. It generally functions whenteams of experts work to solve problems on behalf of legitimate problem ownersand other stakeholders. The design thinking process typically involves a model inwhich practitioners go through several steps. In the earliest, seminal versions ofthe model, practitioners describe the steps as taking place in a problem space anda solution space. In the problem space, the first step is to identify a problem andexplicitly define how it is the real cause for which a solution is sought. In the solu-tion space, the second step is to propose a solution and examine the solution inan effort to ensure that the solution will, indeed, solve the causal problem. At thispoint, most models involve implementation. Most also assume that a serious prob-lem-solving process may require several iterations, with one or more new cyclesthrough each of the two spaces. This is commonly known as the double diamondmodel.",e37

Skoe’s twobooks were training manuals for problem-solving practitioners.",e37

This smallmanual became highly influential, with worldwide circulation. It travelled becauseSITA operates in every nation with an airport. SITA manages telecommunicationsin the airline industry, between and among airlines and air transport serviceproviders, in more than two hundred nations and territories. In developing andrefining his model, Skoe worked in more than one hundred and sixty-five nations,later working in the Scandinavian design industry to help design firms solve clientproblems, while Skoe’s trainees moved from SITA into other high-tech industriesand consulting firms.",e37

In response, banks tried to bypassinterest rate regulations by establishing their own ﬁnance com-panies, which formed an important part of the gray credit market(Berg et al., 1993). The term ‘gray economy’, however, refers toworkers being reimbursed under-the-table, without paying incometaxes or contributing to such public services as Social Security andMedicare. It is sometimes referred to as the underground economyor “hidden economy” in Sweden (Biljer, 1991).",e40

Credit andbond markets were deregulated ﬁrst; regulations on internationaltransactions were removed next. The system of liquidity ratios forbanks was abandoned in 1983 and the ceilings on commercialbank lending were removed in 1985. At the same time, restric-tions on lending rates were lifted. By 1989, all remaining foreignexchange restrictions had been removed (Dress & Pazarbasioglu,1998).",e40

We estimate the time-invariant and time-varying inefﬁ-ciencies of Swedish ﬁnancial enterprises from 1996 to 2011 withfour different estimators. These estimators are the Pooled Model(Aigner et al., 1977), the ﬁxed effects model (Schmidt & Sickles,1984), the random effects model (Battese & Coelli, 1995) and theTRUE FM effects model (Greene, 2005).

A  data  security  modelcomprises of authentication, data encryption and data integrity, data recovery, user protection has to be designed toimprove the data security over cloud. To ensure privacy and data security data protection can be used as a service.To avoid access of data from other users, applying encryption on data that makes data totally unusable andnormal encryption can complicate availability. Before uploading data into the cloud the users are suggested to verifywhether the data is stored on backup drives and the keywords in files remain unchanged. Calculate the hash of thefile before uploading to cloud servers will ensure that the data is not altered. This hash calculation can be used fordata integrity but it is very difficult to maintain it.  RSA based data integrity check can be provided by combiningidentity  based  cryptography  and  RSA  Signature.  SaaS  ensures  that  there  must  be  clear  boundaries  both  at  thephysical level and application level to segregate data from different users. Distributed access control architecture canbe used for access management in cloud computing. To identify unauthorized users, using of credential or attributedbased policies are better. Permission as a service can be used to tell the user that which part of data can be accessed.Fine grained access control mechanism enables the owner to delegate most of computation intensive tasks to cloudservers without disclosing the data contents. A data driven framework can be designed for secure data processingand sharing between cloud users. Network based intrusion prevention system is used to detect threats in real-time.To compute large files with different sizes and to address remote data security RSA based storage security methodcan be used.",e42

In  future  concrete  standards  for  cloud  computingsecurity can be developed. To provide a secure data access in cloud, advanced encryption techniques can be used forstoring and retrieving data from cloud. Also proper key management techniques can be used to distribute the key tothe cloud users such that only authorized persons can access the data.",e42

El conceptode ﬁdelidad apareció por primera vez en la literatura sobre mar-keting en los a ˜nos cuarenta y se entendía como un constructounidimensional indicado por la cuota de mercado y la ﬁdelidad con-ductual (Guest, 1944). Unos 30 a ˜nos después la ﬁdelidad comienza aentenderse como un concepto bidimensional que comprende com-ponentes actitudinales y conductuales (Day, 1969), pero aún nose han explorado las complejas interrelaciones entre estas dimen-siones, ni el proceso dinámico por el que la ﬁdelidad se iniciay se mantiene (McMullan y Gilmore, 2003). Tradicionalmente, lainvestigación sobre la lealtad del consumidor ha empleado variasmedidas comportamentales relacionadas con la compra repetida.Jacoby y Chestnut (1978) criticaron estas medidas comportamen-tales alegando que capturaban solo la parte estática de un procesodinámico y no permitían comprender los factores subyacentes ala compra repetida. Cuando las compras no están guiadas por unaclara actitud positiva, sino por exigencias situacionales, se conside-ran el resultado de una falsa lealtad.

Por ejemplo, sería posible que un consumi-dor presentase una alta ﬁdelidad comportamental pero una bajaﬁdelidad actitudinal, o a la inversa, pudiéndose explicar estos des-ajustes mediante factores situacionales. Esta información podríausarse, por ejemplo, para adaptar la estrategia de marketing al nivelde ﬁdelidad de los consumidores en cada una de las dimensiones. Deesta forma, nuestra propuesta para la conceptualización y medidade la ﬁdelidad del consumidor consideraría 5 facetas de lealtad:propensión a ser leal, ﬁdelidad conductual, recomendaciones boca-oído, intenciones de volver a comprar y ﬁdelidad actitudinal. Estasfacetas no tienen que estar necesariamente sincronizadas ni lineal-mente relacionadas. Por este motivo, en nuestro instrumento no seplantea la obtención de una única puntuación de ﬁdelidad.

2,1205,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,BODY,"Al revisar las medidas sobre ﬁdelidad empleadas en los distintostrabajos de investigación hemos encontrado una enorme varie-dad de ítems utilizados de forma aislada para recoger informaciónsobre distintos aspectos de la lealtad, pero solo una escala con suscorrespondientes estudios psicométricos. Se trata de la escala des-arrollada por McMullan y Gilmore (2003). Está compuesta por 28ítems que intentan medir las 4 etapas del modelo de lealtad descri-tas anteriormente. Se usó un formato de respuesta tipo Likert con 7categorías y etiquetado completo. Se realizó una validación inicialde la escala mediante un análisis factorial exploratorio (AFE), perose aplicó con algunas deﬁciencias metodológicas; esencialmente, elmétodo de extracción de factores fue un análisis de componentesprincipales y el criterio de retención de factores, la regla de Kai-ser. La inadecuación de ambos procedimientos ha sido claramentedemostrada (Ferrando y Anguiano-Carrasco, 2010), por lo que losresultados encontrados no se pueden considerar concluyentes. Porotro lado, existen algunas escalas de ﬁdelidad desarrolladas paramedir solo alguna de las facetas en las que esta puede expresarse. Setrata de los trabajos de: a) Lichtenstein, Drumwright y Braig (2004),que con una escala de 3 ítems miden el compromiso psicológico delos consumidores para comprar en una tienda; b) Nijssen, Singh,Sirdeshmukh y Holzmüeller (2003) y Sirdeshmukh, Singh y Sabol(2002), que utilizaron 4 ítems para medir la probabilidad, expre-sada por el consumidor, de comprar en una tienda en el futuro, y,por último, d) Wulf, Odekerken-Schröder y Iacobucci (2001) des-arrollaron una escala de 3 ítems para evaluar el deseo de ser unconsumidor habitual de una categoría de productos en una tienda.En todos los casos se trataba de escalas muy breves y apenas seaporta información sobre su validez. Respecto a las escalas de ﬁdeli-dad aplicadas en Espa ˜na, hemos encontrado una investigación (SetóPamies, 2003) que realiza una adaptación de una escala (Zeithaml,Berry y Parasuraman, 1996) dise ˜nada para medir una de las facetasde la lealtad, concretamente las intenciones de comportamiento. ElAFE realizado dio como resultado una estructura con 5 dimensio-nes, pero tal y como los propios autores reconocen, solo la primeradimensión consigue un valor adecuado del coeﬁciente alfa, siendonecesaria una revisión de las restantes dimensiones. Además deltrabajo anterior, hay otras investigaciones que dise ˜nan cuestiona-rios ad hoc para recoger esta información.

Anotheroften overlooked force that kindled the interest indesign thinking was the impact of the postmodernculture starting in the 1970s. Postmodernists werevery interested in processes of creation—in literature,theater, cinema, art, and design. In architecturaldesign, for example, this was reﬂected in unprece-dented attention to preliminary sketches. Whereassuch sketches used to be discarded after a designsolution was solidiﬁed, and were never published orexhibited, they were henceforth archived and pub-lished in professional magazines and books.

Later, when developing myunderstanding of the burgeoning ﬁeld of embodiedcognition, it occurred to me that some people whowere familiar with the term design thinking—or hadsimply heard of it—might be interested to know moreabout the developments in cognitive science. Thus,the paper was intended as an introduction to somekey ideas, in a sequence that would be accessible foran audience not familiar with them.

Today the composition of pewter fordomestic use is rigidly controlled, based on British and Europeanstandards, specifying a minimum of 90% tin with the balance beingmade up of copper, antimony and perhaps some bismuth. The maindifference from the seventeenth and eighteenth century ordinancesis that the addition of lead is no longer permitted, with the maxi-mum allowed level being 0.5% – in practice usually far less, so thatlead should be present as a trace element only [1].",e46

All authors found agood correlation between the values obtained by direct determi-nation and by acid digestion. Husáková et al.

Caldaset al. [16–18] determined copper, arsenic and lead in sugar canespirits directly without any sample pretreatment and compared theresults obtained by GF AAS with those found by ICP-MS. Ndung’uet al. [19] observed that the precision for Pb determination in vine-gar improved when using digestion instead of direct analysis. Theauthors also recommended adjusting the graphite furnace temper-ature program taking into consideration the presence of volatileorgano-lead compounds. Cocchi et al.

6,4642,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,BODY,Two simple methods to determine cadmium and lead in dif-ferent kind of beverages and vinegar have been developed. Usingthese methods it was possible to determine accurately cadmiumand lead by direct analysis in different liquids and to evaluate theleaching of these metals from pewter cups. The results presentedin this work showed that pewter cups are not cadmium- and lead-free; this point goes against the manufacturers’ declaration thattheir products are lead-free.,e46

The presence of carbonresidues inside the atomizer conﬁrmed that the pyrolysis stepwould require improvements. In direct solid sampling, chemicalmodiﬁers can reduce matrix effects by (a) modifying the atomiza-tion mechanism of the analyte, often with increased thermalstability, and thus, higher pyrolysis temperatures can be estab-lished without signiﬁcant analyte losses and (b) promoting theextraction of the analyte to the surface of the solid matrix,improving the conditions for atomic cloud generation.

An early performance indicator isneeded to detect students with mathematical problems at an early stage so that relevant actions can be undertaken to mitigatethe problem.  The objective of this paper is to study the effectiveness of the pre-test mathematics questions in predicting theperformance  of  the  students  in  the  subsequent  engineering  mathematics  course.    A  number  of  23  diploma  students  wereselected  and  their  previous  institutional details  were  classified. The  pre-test paper  consists  of  30 objective  questions  whichwere constructed based on the compulsory requirements on several mathematical concepts in engineering course.  The resultsof the pre-test were moderated and compared with the results of two subjects, Vector Calculus and Linear Algebra of the samestudents in the first semester.  The correlation analysis was performed between the pre-test results and the results of VectorCalculus  and  Linear  Algebra.  The  analysis  reveals  a  weak  correlation  between  the  pre-test,  Vector  Calculus  and  AlgebraLinear  results.  However,  a  strong  correlation  was  found  between  Vector  Calculus  and  Linear  Algebra  results.

Additional  effects wantedare: time savings (faster production process flow), lower costfor materials (less waste and scrapped output) and lower costfor  energy  (less  scrapped  output  and  operation  runs moresmoothly  and  optimized),  fewer time/cost/energy-consumingpost  operations  required,  improved  trust  in  the  productionprocess  (thus  allowing higher  calculated  risks  in  terms  oftougher and demanding orders), avoidance of total stops in theproduction process, as well as the ability to detect bottlenecks.",e4

Furthermore, they generally usevarious millilitres of specimen thus limiting the actual time spanof experiments. The proposed chromatographic methods are easyand fast to implement. They use very little specimen and can sub-stitute UV/Vis methods contributing to delete the usage of toxicreagents and/or solvents. The new HPLC method has also turnedout to be more precise and accurate in the quantitative analysisof elemental sulphur in bacterial cultures.",e10

The values yielded by HPLC are systematicallyhigher than ones from solvent extraction with a ratio comprisedbetween 0.46 and 0.67. This can be attributed to the fact that partof the elemental sulphur is not in water suspension but rather isclung to the bacterial cell wall or is in the form of globules thatmay well not be available for solvent extraction. The preparationof HPLC specimen requires the direct addition to the bacterial cul-ture of THF that is fully miscible with water instead. This procedureis likely to destroy the globules dissolving more sulphur and mak-ing it available for the HPLC determination. As we will further dis-cuss in Section 3.4, the mass balances tell that values from HPLCare closer to the real amounts of elemental sulphur in the cultures,",e10
