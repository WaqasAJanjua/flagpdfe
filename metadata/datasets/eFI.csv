The activity ofcellulase and β – glucosidase were estimated as 185 FPU/mL and 500 CBU/mL respectively. The cellulase activity was determined by stan-dard ﬁ lter paper assay (Ghose, 1987). One unit of enzyme activity(FPU) is de ﬁ ned as the amount of enzyme required to liberate 1 mmolof glucose from ﬁ lter paper in 60 min at 50°C and pH 4.8. The β – glucosidase activity was determined by measuring the amount of #NAME? #NAME? – β – -glucopyranoside ( NPG)(Parry et al., 2001). One unit of enzyme activity (CBU) is de ﬁ ned as theamount of enzyme required to produce 1 mmol of nitrophenol from − nitrophenyl-b- -glucopyranoside ( NPG) per minute at 50 °C and pH5.0."

e25,2755,"biomass production and PHB accumulation were investigated and theresults were presented in Table 3. The results suggested that the cellbiomass and PHB production were signi ﬁ cantly higher with (NH ) SO ;however, the PHB content of the dry cell (%) was signi ﬁ cantly higherwith peptone than other organic and inorganic nitrogen tested(p < 0.05). Thus, the results clearly evidenced that the (NH ) SO greatly enhances both the new cell formation and PHB accumulation;however, peptone mainly promotes the PHB accumulation rather thannew cell production. The productivity (g/L/h) and PHB yield (g/gsugar) were about 0.033 and 0.11, 0.024 and 0.08, 0.022 and 0.07,0.005 and 0.02, and 0.025 and 0.09 with (NH ) SO , NH Cl, NH NO , yeast extract and peptone, respectively. It is suggested that the pro-ductivity and yield obtained in this study was signi ﬁ cantly higher with(NH ) SO than the other nitrogen sources tested (p < 0.05). Based onthe results, it is clearly evidenced that nitrogen sources highly in ﬂ u-enced the cell biomass production and PHB accumulation and(NH ) SO was the most suitable for high yield of PHB. Similarly,several other studies also suggested that the inorganic nitrogen such asammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate were most suitable ni-trogen sources for better cell growth and PHB production (Gouda et al.,2001; Sreekanth et al., 2013); however, Pal et al. (2009); Zhang et al.(2013) were reported that tryptone (organic) as a suitable nitrogensource for high yield of PHB. 32.6 % with the C/N ratio of 10, 20, 40, 80 and N-free condition, re-spectively. The accumulation of PHB was signi ﬁ cantly increased withincreasing the C/N ratio from 10 to 80; however, N – free condition ( ∞ )resulted decrease in PHB content (p < 0.05). The results con ﬁ rmedthat the more preferred high N – de ﬁ cient condition (C/N − 80) than the N-free condition ( ∞ ) and the high C/N de ﬁ cient is notsuitable for cell biomass production, but most favorable for the accu-mulation of PHB. Lee et al., (2008); Kulpreecha et al., (2009) were alsosuggested that the high C/N limitation promotes the PHB accumulationand signi ﬁ cantly a ﬀ ects the cell biomass production. Several otherstudies were also investigated on the e ﬀ ects of C/N ratio for the better production of PHB and concluded that the nitrogen limitation favors thePHB accumulation while minimizing the cell growth (Yu and Stahl,2008; Johnson et al., 2010; Annamalai and Sivakumar, 2016)."

e27,2755,As metaldehyde is a highly polar substance (log = 0.12) it wasimportant to investigate its retention behaviour and recovery from theHLB-L disk. Results from batch extraction tests using spiked river watershowed that this sorbent material was e ﬀ ective at retaining metaldehydeand that the compound could subsequently be eluted readily using me-thanol. Average recoveries (n = 11) for the duplicate river water samples were 95.5% ( ± 11.2% RSD) and 98.2% ( ± 10.6%spiked at 300 ng L were 92.7% ( ± 4.1% RSD) and 95.5% ( ± 4.7%RSD) and at 600 ng LRSD).

The hedonic vs. utilitarian nature of the product was mea-sured with two dichotomous scales (practical purpose/just for fun;for a routine need/for pleasure) based on Wakeﬁeld and Inman(2003). Perceived brand quality, which was included in the analysisas a covariate, was assessed using a subset of two items from Parkand Kim (2001). Principal components analyses with varimax rota-tion were performed to evaluate the dimensionality of the scales.The results suggested that the corresponding items of each scalecould be grouped into a single factor with signiﬁcant factor load-ings, and the explained variance exceeded 60% in each case. Scalereliabilities were assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. All the scalesexhibited a high degree of reliability."
