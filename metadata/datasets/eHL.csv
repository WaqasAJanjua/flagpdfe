e32,517,"The analysis of carbohydrates in foods has extreme nutritionalimportance since they contribute with 40–50% of the caloric intakeof human beings [1]. The constant increase in obesity indices, dia-betes and some CHO intolerances intensify the necessity of theirrigorous control. In the food industry, they are used as technolog-ical coadjuvants in order to obtain physicochemical and sensorialcharacteristics of foods [2,3], but they also serve as quality markersduring processing [4]. Milk, when subjected to excessive heating,suffers a lactose isomerization reaction forming lactulose and epi-lactose. Both have ssmaller biological values than lactose and maycause negative effects like ﬂatulence [4–7]. The presence of anexcessive amount of glucose in ground coffee after hydrolysis indi-cates product adulteration from the addition of other grains [8]. Inrice bran, a food industry by-product, xylose is the predominantcarbohydrate, which has been used as a source for obtaining xyl-itol (a compound with high sweetening power) [9]. In wines, thequantiﬁcation of CHOs is correlated with ﬁnal product conserva-tion. Studies indicate that the majority of microorganisms used forthe fermentation process consume more glucose than fructose. So,high contents of fructose in wine can compromise its preservation The determination of different CHOs is a signiﬁcant challenge,since they are analytes of difﬁcult separation and present similarphysicochemical characteristics [12,13]. Several analytical tech-niques have been studied for this purpose, among them highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary elec-trophoresis (CE). CE is an ascending technique for this type ofanalysis, since the fused-silica capillary withstands highly alkalinepHs, above 11.5, allowing the ionization of CHOs, which facilitatesseparation [14–21]. Besides this, the technique has been largelyemployed owing to its low reagent consumption and waste gen-eration [14,22–26]. Various kinds of separations have already beenstudied with CE, emphasizing capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE),with or without derivatization reactions, and micellar electroki-netic chromatography (MEKC) with cationic surfactant [14–21].Despite several investigations developed to separate CHOs in foodmatrices, one can still verify some separations difﬁculties still exist,mainly between maltose and glucose [14], glucose and galactose[22], galactose, maltose and maltotriose [23], fructose and xylose[24] and fructose and mannose [8], separations that are very impor-tant for the food industry. The MEKC with anionic surfactant is atype of separation employed in several food analyses and is basedon analyte partition into two phases, the micellar phase and the runelectrolyte. The formation of micelles occurs by the addition of sur-factant agents to the electrolyte, in concentrations above the criticalmicellar concentration [27]. Bao et al. [28] observed good results"

e33,588,"Climate services have become the focus of major international coordination and development activities over the past fewyears. In 2009 the World Climate Conference-3 brought together heads of states, government ministers, industry represen-tatives, and scientiﬁc and technical experts who laid out the clear need for climate services. In 2012 the Global Frameworkfor Climate Services (GFCS) was approved by governments worldwide at the Extraordinary World Meteorological Congress.In parallel to the GFCS, climate service providers, users and funders are collaborating through an informal Climate ServicesPartnership, to further ensure climate services are effectively developed, delivered and used (see Vaughan and Dessai, 2014for a recent review)."
