From the literature it is known that in newsvendor-type settings with randomdemand and deterministic supply the activities in supply chains can be coordinatedby sophisticated contracts while the simple wholesale price contract fails to achievecoordination due to the double marginalization effect. Advanced contracts aretypically characterized by risk sharing mechanisms between the actors, which havethe potential to coordinate the supply chain. Regarding the opposite setting withrandom supply and deterministic demand, literature offers a considerably smallerspectrum of solution schemes. While contract types for the well-known stochasti-cally proportional yield have been analyzed under different settings, other yielddistributions have not received much attention in the literature so far. However,practice shows that yield types strongly depend on the industry and the productionprocess that is considered. As consequence, they can deviate very much from the",

This paper analyzes a buyer–supplier supply chain in a random yield, deterministic demand setting with pro-duction yield of a binomial type. It is shown how under binomially distributedyields risk sharing contracts can be used to coordinate buyer’s ordering and sup-plier’s production decision. Both parties are exposed to risks of overproduction andunder-delivery. In contrast to settings with stochastically proportional yield, how-ever, the impact of yield uncertainty can be quite different in the binomial yieldcase.

The current analytical study reveals that, like understochastically proportional yield, coordination is impeded by double marginalizationif a simple wholesale price contract is applied. However, more sophisticated con-tracts which penalize or reward the supplier can change the risk distribution so thatsupply chain coordination is possible also under binomial yield. In this context,many contract properties from planning under stochastically proportional yieldcarry over. Nevertheless, numerical examples reveal that a misspeciﬁcation of theyield type can considerably downgrade the extent of supply chain coordination.",

s1,18,34,2,766,1001,51,249,337,VlqtgtAdvPTimes,9,BODY,"Uncertainties are widely spread in supply chains with demand and supplyuncertainties being the most common types. Regarding the supply side, businessrisks primarily result from yield uncertainty which is typical for a variety ofbusiness sectors. It frequently occurs in the agricultural sector or in the chemical,electronic and mechanical manufacturing industries (see Gurnani et al. 2000; Joneset al. 2001; Kazaz 2004; Nahmias 2009). Here, random supply can appear due todifferent reasons such as weather conditions, production process risks or imperfectinput material. In a supply chain context, yield or supply randomness obviouslyinﬂuences the risk position of the actors and, therefore, has an effect on the buyer–supplier relationship in a supply chain. The question that arises is to what extentthe decisions of the single supply chain actors and therandom yields affectperformance of the whole supply chain. In this study, we limit ourselves to aproblem setting with deterministic demand. This is to focus the risk analysis ofcontracting on the random yield aspect which is of practical relevance for",

This is differentfrom a situation with stochastically proportional yield where production yield is arandom fraction of production input and neither mean nor variance of the yield ratedepends on the batch size. Thus, a reasonable conjecture is that under binomiallydistributed yields, the risk allocation between the single actors is different from thatunder stochastically proportional yields. Hence, contract schemes with different risk-sharing mechanisms may perform differently when the lot size inﬂuences the‘‘amount of risk’’ in the supply chain and may change the proposed contract types’coordination efﬁciency.

So it becomes evident that the general coordination properties ofthe studied contracts, including the ability of proﬁt split, do not differ between thedifferent yield types although under binomial yield, different from stochasticallyproportional yield, the level of the yield uncertainty is critically dependent on thesize of the production batch. This property, however, will in ﬁrst line affect the sizeof the production and order decision.",
s1,1482,6328,25,17237,17522,51,189,337,VlqtgtAdvPTimes,9,BODY,"Regarding the production quantity, it is found in this paper that demand is inﬂatedto some extent to cope with yield losses. The respective inﬂation factor, however, isnot a constant multiplier of demand like in the case of stochastically proportionalyield (see Inderfurth and Clemens 2014). Instead, depending on the cost, price andyield data this inﬂation factor might increase or decrease with increasing demandlevel and approaches the reciprocal of the expected yield rate when demand tends tobecome very large. This is due to the characteristic of binomial yields tomonotonically decrease the output risk as the production input level rises up to alevel where this risk almost vanishes. The consequences are twofold. First, undercomparable parameter settings and identical demand the production level under",
s1,1482,6329,25,17237,17522,51,189,337,VlqtgtAdvPTimes,9,BODY,"binomial yield is lower and the expected supply chain proﬁt is higher than in the caseof stochastically proportional yield. Second, in high-demand environments thecoordination deﬁcit of the simple WHP contract becomes negligible because theyield risk almost disappears in case of binomial yield so that the production decisionsin the centralized and decentralized supply chain setting tend to coincide. This iscompletely different from what is valid under stochastically proportional yield.",

In the case of decentralized decision making under a WHPcontract, however, the proﬁt loss for the whole supply chain is in general smaller. Insome speciﬁc cases the supply chain can even proﬁt from yield misspeciﬁcation sincethe wrong buyer’s order and supplier’s reaction can improve the total supply chainperformance. ‘‘Effects of yield misspeciﬁcation if real yield is stochasticallyproportional’’ in Appendix reveals that the same qualitative outcome (with differentquantitative results) is found in the case of a reverse misspeciﬁcation, i.e., if binomialyield is assumed but the real yield is stochastically proportional. The lesson that canbe learnt from this speciﬁc investigation is that it is very important to specify theyield type correctly. It would be highly interesting to ﬁnd out if one can distinguishdata settings where it really matters to use the true yield model. Such a study,however, is beyond the scope of this paper and will be a matter of future research.Additionally, further research should focus on extending the supply chain to anemergency option for procuring extra units in case of under-delivery. This optionwas introduced by Inderfurth and Clemens (2014) and it was shown to coordinatethe supply chain by applying the WHP contract. This, however, only holds if thesupplier, and not the buyer, is able to utilize the emergency source. In the currentsetting, this option might reveal a similar performance. Besides, the setting can alsobe adjusted with respect to supply chain structure. An important aspect in thiscontext is the extension from a serial to a converging supply chain. Anotherinteresting extension of the current work would lie in a contract analysis for anenvironment where demand is also random. From research in the case ofstochastically proportional yield (see Yan and Liu 2009) we know that the simplecontracts considered in this paper cannot guarantee coordination while morecomplex ones might do so. It is an open question, however, if these results also holdunder binomially distributed yields.",

s3,16,42,1,50,332,51,159,238,AdvPTimes,9,BODY,"Rapid removal of noxious synthetic dyes fromwastewater is of great concern in the scientiﬁc research ﬁeld,this is due to the expansion of harmful effects of syntheticdyes traces in water streams on the environment and humanhealth with the exponential rise in concentration of syntheticdye globally and demand in various industries that coincidedwith the implantation of more stringent water quality stan-dards. Various technologies have been applied for the re-moval of synthetic dye from wastewater, including adsorptiontechnology, which has a great potential in treating varieties ofsynthetic dyes. This article comprehensively reviews the lat-est progress in the development of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)and their applications for the removal of synthetic dyes from",

s3,319,510,8,5936,5994,51,159,238,AdvPTimes,9,BODY,"surface modiﬁcation of CNTs, in general, improves theadsorption capacity of adsorbents probably due to the in-creased number of active binding sites resulting from sur-face modiﬁcation and formation of new functional groupsthat favors the adsorption of synthetic dyes. Althoughsurface modiﬁcation of CNTs can enhance the adsorptionof synthetic dyes, the cost of chemicals used and methodsof modiﬁcation also have to be taken into consideration. Asfar as the modiﬁcation of an adsorbent surface mightchange the overall properties of the adsorbent, charac-terization studies involving surface area pore size, porosityare recommended for any future work on surface modiﬁ-cation of CNTs.",

Inthe present study, iron oxide nanoparticles were connectedto methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) via a newmethod. The mPEG was acrylated at ﬁrst and Michaelreaction was carried out between acrylated mPEG and3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane as a coupling agent. Thechemical structures of modiﬁed mPEG were characterizedby Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) andnuclear magnetic resonance. In the next step, iron oxidenanoparticle was coupled with the above-mentioned adduct.Preparation of magnetic nanoparticles with average particlesize of 20–30 nm was proved by scanning electronmicroscopy. The structure of mPEG grafted on the surfaceof MNPs was conﬁrmed by FT-IR spectroscopy and thermalgravimetric analysis. The synthesized nanoparticles havethe potential to be used in different biomedical applications.",

The obtained complex has been characterized bythe spectroscopic techniques and mass spectrometry. Thecomplex exhibits high thermal stability and forms ZnOnanoparticles on thermal decomposition. The diffractionpeaks in the X-Ray diffraction spectra indicated that thecomplexes are crystalline. The surface morphology hasbeen investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Energydispersive X-ray analysis shows the chemical purity andstoichiometry of the ZnO nanoparticles. The BET surfacearea of ZnO nanoparticles has been found. The transmis-sion electron microscopy result shows spherical shapedZnO nanoparticles with the size of 20 nm. Quantum con-ﬁnement effects are clearly revealed in UV–Vis spectros-copy technique.",

From the results of XRD, SEM, TEM, andBET, the ZnO nanoparticles are spherical shaped singlecrystalline with the size of 20 nm and also have largespeciﬁc surface areas. The blue shift in the absorption",

It was found thatamino-modiﬁed ordered mesoporous silica materials showsigniﬁcant adsorption for 2-CPh and 2,4-DCPh. This ispossible due to the alkaline and acid interactions among theamine functional groups and chlorophenols. The adsor-bents were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogentransformadsorption–desorption isotherms and Fourierinfrared. Batch adsorption studies were done to study theeffect of various parameters like chemical modiﬁcation,pH, contact time, adsorbent dose and initial concentration.It was found that adsorption of 2-CPh and 2,4-DCPhdepends upon the solution pH. Adsorption data weremodeled with the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorptionisotherms. The data ﬁtted the Freundlich isotherm modelbetter than Langmuir. The kinetics analysis revealed that",

The higher adsorption capacityof mesoporous silica materials functionalized with aminemay be explained to proceed via electrostatic interactionbetween the surface of adsorbent and chlorophenol; alsothis may be because of the hydrophobicity created byamine groups.

The results showed that the HPAis strongly bounded to the support surface and loadingpercentage is an important factor. The signiﬁcance of thisstudy using inexpensive and easily prepared catalystsfundamentally lies in the fact that their applications wouldlead to an alternative technology for the other systems forremoval of toxic chemicals from the waste water, whichare of interest for the environmental scientists, and nano-technologists, along with the advantages from the envi-ronmental point of view. In addition, we hope this simpleexperimental setup and procedure make this method auseful addition to the present methodologies and applica-",
