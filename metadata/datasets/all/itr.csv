i1,9,32,1,50,560,36,212,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,Vehicle detection and counting is important for many appli-
i1,9,33,1,50,560,36,212,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"cations such as surveillance, trafﬁc management, and rescuetasks. The ability of on-line monitoring of vehicles distri-bution in the urban environments prevents trafﬁc jams andcongestions which in turn reduces air and noise pollution.In terms of surveillance, the accurate estimation of vehicles inparking lots or roads is essential for making right decisions.Therefore, this problem has attracted the attention of theresearchers in the recent years. However, vehicle detectionand counting is a challenging task due to many reasons suchas: small size of the vehicles, different types and orientations,"
i1,9,34,1,50,560,36,212,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,similarity in visual appearance of vehicles and some other
i1,9,35,1,50,560,36,212,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"objects (e.g., air conditioning units on the buildings, trashbins, and road marks), and detection time in very high res-olution images is another challenge that researchers need totake in consideration. Fig. 1 shows vehicles in aerial images"
i1,9,36,1,50,560,36,212,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,and some of the aforementioned challenges.
i1,10,37,1,50,559,297,213,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,The solution for this task can be categorized into two
i1,10,38,1,50,559,297,213,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"groups namely ﬁxed-ground sensors and image-based sen-sors. In ﬁxed-ground sensors, trafﬁc information and vehiclemonitoring are collected efﬁciently using different types ofﬁxed ground sensors such as stationary camera, radar sensors,bridge sensors, and induction loop [1], [2]. These sensorsgive a partial overview about vehicles density, parking lotssituation, and trafﬁc ﬂow. However, the overall informationof trafﬁc situation will not be available, which is importantfor road network monitoring and planning, trafﬁc statistics,and optimization. On the other hand, image-based sensorscome from two sources: satellites and airplanes or unmanned"

Then,the output of FCRN goes under empirical threshold whichresults a binary image. Finally, a simple connected compo-nent algorithm is used for ﬁnding the locations and countof the blobs that represent the detected vehicles. The resultsof the proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-artmethods. We have achieved the highest true positive rate andthe lowest false alarm rate. In addition, the F1 and precisionscores are better than the state-of-the-art methods. Howeverthe proposed system consumes more time during inferencecompared with the other systems. The future work will befocusing on a much faster model with better performance."

i2,11,16,1,50,420,36,80,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"Recently, we have seen a wide range of blockchain ﬁnancialapplications [1], [2] as well as an array of global companiesadopting blockchain technology for various services [3]–[5].introduced as Bitcoin’sBlockchain technology was ﬁrstunderlying technology [6] but soon later its extendable capa-bilities have been recognized."
i2,12,17,1,50,503,36,237,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"The peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is a core inno-vation in the ﬁnancial sector nowadays. Its underlying tech-nology, blockchain, is a type of a distributed ledger speciallysuitable for processing time ordered data. In addition, embed-ded cryptography functions of blockchain technology enableintegrity of ledgers, authenticity of transactions, and privacy"
i2,12,18,1,50,503,36,237,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"of transactions without a centralized control actor. Thosemake the blockchain different from traditional distributeddatabase systems being used in the ﬁnancial sector, e.g., itis practically impossible to modify or delete records of aledger in the blockchain. This distributed and decentralizednature of the blockchain has attracted ﬁnancial institutionsover the world to replace existing backbone technologieswith blockchain technology. For instance, according to [7],blockchain technology could save between US $5 billion and$10 billion in reinsurance thanks to improvements to place-ment, claims settlement, and compliance checks. Anotherexample is a blockchain based stock exchange that willchange share trading more dramatically without a centralizedsystem."
i2,13,19,1,50,742,36,33,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"Not only ﬁnancial institutions are making these actions.Key companies in other sectors are adopting blockchain tech-nology. For instance, the logistics sector considers blockchain"
i2,14,20,1,50,419,297,81,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"technology for real-time visibility, improved efﬁciency, trans-parency, veriﬁability, and cost reduction for logistics. Theproperty sector is adopting blockchain technology as wellfor digital but unforgeable property records, few disputes,transparency, veriﬁability, and lower transfer fees. The foodsector is also investing blockchain technology to trace themovements of foods and tackle contamination faster."
i2,15,21,1,50,503,297,213,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"In this paper, we consider blockchain technology as anew functional technology to create a new ID as a Ser-vice (IDaaS). A blockchain based ID as a Service (BIDaaS)is introduced with one practical example for mobile users ofa mobile telecommunication company. In the proposal, thereare three entities involved: user (e.g., mobile user), BIDaaS"
i2,15,22,1,50,503,297,213,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"provider (e.g., telecommunication company), and partner ofthe BIDaaS provider (e.g., partner of the telecommunicationcompany). Mutual authentication between the user and thepartner is established without any pre-shared information orsecurity credential shared among them. In other words, theuser does not require any ID creation to the partner offer-ing services to the user. The BIDaaS blockchain, where theBIDaaS provider and its partners have permissions to access,provides required information for IDaaS. Furthermore, theproposal allows the partner to selectively request other infor-mation of the user (e.g., real name, mobile phone number,postal address, etc.) from the BIDaaS provider."

As the mobile user’s informa-tion is already registered at the mobile telecommunicationcompany, the mobile user simply needs to generate its virtualID and requests to register it with the corresponding publickey into the BIDaaS blockchain. Note that the virtual IDregistration can be done before the mobile user accesses theonline shopping mall and multiple virtual ID pre-registrationsare also possible."

The ﬁrst thing to consider is to develop ascheme to detect or prevent misuse of the provided userinformation at the partner. It can be implemented as a cloudplatform that the partner is only granted to access for permit-ted services. The second is to develop a secure TEE operation

The public and private key pairis generated at the mobile phone and besides private key isstored at the mobile phone. Today the TEE provides the mostsecure area that guarantees code and data loaded inside to beprotected in terms of conﬁdentiality and integrity.

Compared with CPSthat rely on stationary and huge machines or sensors andemphasize how to utilize cyber components to better masterthe physical world, mobile CPS concentrate on their mobility,which could seamlessly and ubiquitously sense data inpeople’s daily lives. Therefore, mobile CPS are able to be"

Thus, compared with CPS, mobile CPS couldhave much more data resources and could analyze and con-nect physical systems with more data.

Using a looped-back system conﬁguration,we achieve 5.68 b/s/Hz over a trans-Paciﬁc-equivalent distance of11 046 km. Net spectral efﬁciencies are increased by 18% and 80%by using PS, at 5523 km and 11 046 km, respectively, comparedto uniform square QAM. Throughout our experiments, we payparticular attention that our claims are backed by implementableforward error correction schemes. In addition, we demonstratereal-time coherent transmission of single-carrier 200 and 250-Gb/suniform 8-QAM and 16-QAM at 4 b/s/Hz over the 5523-km cable."

This is be-cause a more uniform PS constellation has a smaller minimumEuclidean distance between constellation symbols for the sameaverage power. Therefore, for a given noise power, the perfor-mance of those DSP functions that rely on symbol decisions,such as the LMS equalization, can deteriorate as the constella-tion becomes more uniform. This practical aspect of PS nicelyreveals that implementation penalties, both from hardware im-perfections and from DSP and coding imperfections, cannot beneglected in optimizing a PS system."

This isbecause the AIR of U-QPSK is saturated almost at its entropyrate with a large SNR margin with a negligible FEC overhead(OH), suggesting that U-16-QAM with a greater FEC OH willyield a better AIR, which however could not be implemented dueto unstable coherent DSP for U-16-QAM.

i5,9,45,1,50,625,36,152,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are usually composed ofa large number of energy-constrained sensor nodes that arerandomly distributed in a wide monitoring area to collect,perceive, and integrate data [1]. Given the restriction onnode size, economic cost, calculation ability, and energy sup-plement infeasibility, the sensing range and communicationrange of a single sensor node are limited [2]. Therefore,sensor nodes have to communicate with the base station (BS)by self-organization and by a multi-hop wireless communica-tion network. However, WSNs are often deployed in inacces-sible outdoor environments with large geographical spaces"
i5,9,46,1,50,625,36,152,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"and network sizes at long distances, thereby causing high"
i5,10,47,1,50,623,297,153,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"communication delay [3]. Multi-hop communication alsoundoubtedly leads to high routing overhead and improves thecommunication failure probability. These consequences areunacceptable for scenarios that require high real-time perfor-mance [4]. The constrained energy of nodes is also one of themost notable features of WSNs. In some applications, sensornodes are deployed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)into extreme environments that cannot be easily reached byhumans [5], thus leading to coverage holes in some parts ofthe monitoring area if some nodes run out of energy. Thisphenomenon not only causes lack of perceptual data integritybut also disconnects the network in the event of node death,"

i5,19,69,2,882,972,36,416,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"Many traditional clustering routing algorithms have beenproposed to solve the energy optimization problem. The low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) algorithm [7]uses circular random clustering methods, and each node hasthe opportunity to become a cluster head in rotation. How-ever, LEACH assumes that each node has sufﬁcient power tocommunicate with the BS via a single hop, thereby causing ahuge energy consumption with the increase of the distancebetween the cluster head and the BS. The hybrid energy-efﬁcient distributed (HEED) [8] clustering approach inher-its the clustering idea of LEACH and further considers theenergy constraint in calculating the probability of selecting anode as the cluster head. HEED, however, cannot guaranteethe balance of the energy consumption of the cluster headsand this will lead to the premature death of these cluster"

i5,19,73,2,882,972,36,416,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,also an energy-efﬁcient routing algorithm based on LEACH.
i5,19,74,2,882,972,36,416,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"In this algorithm, the cluster head with the maximum residual"

i5,19,77,2,882,972,36,416,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,LEACH-ERE and EE-LEACH assume that the cluster head
i5,19,78,2,882,972,36,416,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"can communicate with the BS directly, and this assumption"
i5,19,79,2,882,972,36,416,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,is inapplicable to large-scale WSNs because a single sensor
i5,19,80,2,882,972,36,416,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,node generally does not have a high transmission power. The

i5,19,84,2,882,972,36,416,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,energy of nodes. Although CUCRA is more practical than
i5,19,85,2,882,972,36,416,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"LEACH, CUCRA may lead to an excessive number of clusterheads and result in a long transmission delay."
i5,20,86,2,882,1390,36,225,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,Collaborative beamforming (CB) is an effective technique
i5,20,87,2,882,1390,36,225,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"for improving the energy efﬁciency of WSNs [12]. UsingCB, nodes with limited transmission power can form a virtualarray antenna that transmits a high-gain and high-directivitybeam to achieve direct communication with the BS withoutmulti-hop. CB can not only reduce communication delay butalso obtain the energy gain and prolong the lifetime of anetwork [13]. While synchronization and information sharinghave to be overcome to use CB in WSNs [14], the deteriora-tion of the beam pattern caused by the node position error isusually considered the main problem of CB in WSNs [15].In WSNs, sensor nodes are usually deployed randomly in the"
i5,20,88,2,882,1390,36,225,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,monitoring area. Although the mainlobe of the node array
i5,20,89,2,882,1390,36,225,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"cannot be affected by the node position error if the numberof array nodes is sufﬁciently large, the sidelobe performanceis closely related to the position error [16]. A lower sidelobeindicates a lower interference at other directions. In addition,"
i5,20,90,2,882,1390,36,225,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"a large number of array nodes will result in an increaseof the average energy consumption of nodes [17], which is"
i5,21,91,2,882,948,297,57,241,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"not desired in WSNs. Consequently, the inﬂuence of nodeposition error on both the mainlobe and the sidelobe mustbe overcome, and the maximum sidelobe level (SLL) of thebeam pattern must be reduced. Therefore, how to select theoptimal array nodes is a key issue for CB in WSNs."

There-fore, the convergence speed of the algorithm must be furtherimproved so that the algorithm can ﬁnd the optimal solutionin a short period. Thus, we propose a novel algorithm calledCSCSO that combines CS [31] and CSO [32] to improve theperformance. In the proposed algorithm, by introducing thehierarchical mechanism of CSO algorithm, the utilization ofthe populations in CS is improved. Moreover, we introducean initial solution optimization mechanism based on chaostheory [33] and weight coefﬁcient to improve the quality ofthe initial population and the convergence speed of CSCSO,"

The ﬁgure indicates that the solution ofCSCSO exhibits higher accuracy and faster convergence ratebecause CSCSO includes chaos-based initial solution mech-anism and the initial solutions of the algorithm are distributedin more favorable positions. Moreover, CSCSO can deter-mine the steps of the Lévy ﬂight adaptively based on the timewhen the same optimal solution appears and prevent the algo-rithm from getting stuck in the local optimum by utilizing theweight coefﬁcient in the Lévy ﬂight mechanism.

i6,8,32,1,50,343,43,141,426,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"Trajectory mining is an interesting data mining problem. Traditionally, it is either assumedthat the time-ordered location data recorded as trajectories are either deterministic or that the uncertainty,e.g., due to equipment or technological limitations, is removed by incorporating some pre-processingroutines. Thus, the trajectories are processed as deterministic paths of mobile object location data. However,it is important to understand that the transformation from uncertain to deterministic trajectory data may resultin the loss of information about the level of conﬁdence in the recorded events. Probabilistic databases offerways to model uncertainties using possible world semantics. In this paper, we consider uncertain sensordata and transform this to probabilistic trajectory data using pre-processing routines. Next, we model thisdata as tuple level uncertain data and propose dynamic programming-based algorithms to mine interestingtrajectories. A comprehensive empirical study is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Theresults show that the trajectories could be modeled and worked as probabilistic data and that the results couldbe computed efﬁciently using dynamic programming."

However, there are severalchallenges posed by the processing of trajectory data.Typically, the volume of rapidly accumulated trajectory datais large, which makes storage of the data a non-trivial task.Moreover, the deﬁnition of a similarity metric for comparingtrajectories, which is a basic requirement for trajectory min-ing, is very important as trajectories may be generated withdifferent sampling strategies considering varying samplingrates. In addition to this, processing queries on large volumesof trajectory data is complicated because of the time andspace complexities [14], [15]. Typically, pre-processing isperformed on the data which involves cleaning, segmentation,completion, calibration, and sampling."

Someapproaches have already been developed to complete uncer-tain trajectories and support data mining tasks [20]–[24].Heterogeneous trajectories represent discrete approxima-tions of the original routes and have various strategiesand rates of sampling.

i7,7,9,1,50,321,43,117,426,TimesLTStd-Roman,9,BODY,"Mobile edge computing (MEC) that affords service to the vicinity of mobile devices (MDs)has become a key technology for future network. Ofﬂoading big data to the MEC server for preprocessingis an attractive approach of MDs. In this paper, we investigate data ofﬂoading from MDs to MEC servers,and a coalitional game-based pricing scheme is proposed. We apply coalitions to arrange data ofﬂoading ofMDs as well as depict the ofﬂoading relationship between MDs and MEC servers. Furthermore, pricing isutilized as the stimuli for the ofﬂoading. In the proposed scheme, a scheduled MD in a coalition chooses anMEC server within the same coalition for ofﬂoading, and pays the selected MEC server for the MEC service.By analyzing the formulated coalitional non-transferable utility game, theoretical properties are derived andsufﬁcient conditions for the core existence are given. Finally, the utility performances of the proposed schemeare demonstrated by numerical results."

The proposed scheme incorporates MD schedul-ing, MEC server selection, and ofﬂoading encouragement.A coalitional NTU game is formulated, and some theoreticalproperties are derived by analysis on the game thereafter.Especially, we give sufﬁcient conditions for non-empty core.In the end, numerical results verify the effectiveness of theproposed scheme by showing the utility performance."

i8,7,13,1,50,253,48,287,251,Times-Bold,8,BODY,"— The number of advanced driver assistance sys-tems (ADASs) and the level of automation in modern vehiclesis increasing at a rapid pace. Moreover, multiple of these ADASscan be active at the same time and therefore may need to interactwith each other. As a consequence, the design of the supervisorlayer that is responsible for proper coordination of the controltasks performed by the low-level ADASs controllers is becoming"
i8,7,14,1,50,253,48,287,251,Times-Bold,8,BODY,"more complex and safety-critical. For this reason, there is astrong need for automated synthesis tools that lead to supervisorsthat are safe by design. In this paper, we present a systematicapproach to model-based supervisor design using discrete-eventsystem representations. In particular, this paper shows that theproposed method is suitable to deal with the multiple andcomplex systems of interacting ADASs. To be more speciﬁc,in contrast to current practice, which often relies on textualspeciﬁcations and exhaustive testing, the proposed method hasfour main advantages: 1) it is based on mathematically speciﬁedrequirements that only allow one interpretation; 2) it preventsblocking situations by design; 3) it guarantees correctness inthe sense that the resulting supervisor satisﬁes all the speciﬁedrequirements; and 4) code is generated from the obtainedsupervisor which eliminates the need for manual coding. Theproposed method is demonstrated by means of a case studyon cruise control and adaptive cruise control. The resultingsupervisor is validated by simulations and experiments on amodern passenger vehicle. Based on the results presented inthis paper, it can be concluded that the model-based supervisordesign, simulation, and implementation method is promising andpowerful for future applications in the automated vehicle systems."

As such,the various assistancesystems present in modern vehicles have a strong interactionand therefore, can no longer be regarded as separate systems.According to the overview provided in [6], it is expected thatin the near future ADASs fully cooperate with the powertrainmanagement.

Forexample, in Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), depending on theinter-vehicle distance and the relative speed, various low-levelADAS controllers are used to drive the throttle and brake. Thepurpose of the supervisor layer is to coordinate the low-levelcontrollers according to the driver’s decisions and sensor data.The driver’s decisions are communicated to the supervisorthrough the Human-Machine-Interface (HMI). The goal of thesupervisor thus is to enforce safe and reliable behavior of theoverall system during operation."

i8,26,39,2,892,950,48,547,251,Times-Roman,9,BODY,"Although designing of ADAS systems has been studiedfor many years, only recently formal synthesis, validationand veriﬁcation methods for ADASs have been proposed inthe literature. In [10], distributed hybrid system veriﬁcationis used to verify that a control system for cars equippedwith ACC is collision-free. In [11], an ACC scheme isproposed that combines a model-predictive control schemewith a formally veriﬁed safety controller. In [12], safetyspeciﬁcations for ACC systems are veriﬁed via the con-struction of control barrier functions. The work in [13]exploits game theoretic techniques to synthesize a hybridcontroller for automated highway systems thatis safe bydesign. In [14], a synthesis method is proposed that relies onlinear temporal logic speciﬁcations and that results in correct-by-construction control software for ACC. The aforementionedworks focus on the correctness of individual low-level ADAScontrollers. Despite the growing complexity of ADASs, onlya few references address the design of supervisory con-"
i8,26,40,2,892,950,48,547,251,Times-Roman,9,BODY,"trollers. Speciﬁcally, [13], [15], [16], proposed supervisors forplatooning maneuvers such as merging and splitting. The cor-rectness of supervisor designs was established by debugging.Proper design of a supervisor for a highly complex systemis in general challenging due to the large dimension of thestate space of the system [17]. For example,the platoonmaneuver supervisor proposed in [15] already involves about500,000 states and 10,000,000 transitions. Hence, manualderivation of a supervisor for an uncontrolled system thatleads to the desired behavior, especially when there is astrong interaction between systems components, is difﬁcultand often results in supervisors that contain so-called blockingsituations during operation. Blocking occurs when the systemends up in a state from which it cannot be driven towardsany desired state. In particular, given the safety-critical natureof ADASs, it is essential to prevent blocking, as it mightlead to hazardous situations. Due to the complexity and thelarge dimension of the state-space of interacting ADASs,blocking situations cannot always be overseen beforehand.In [13] and [15], the aforementioned issues were addressedby using formal speciﬁcation and veriﬁcation tools for debug-ging. However, especially for a complex system with many"
i8,26,41,2,892,950,48,547,251,Times-Roman,9,BODY,"coupled components, this can still be a very tedious and time-consuming process. Hence, there is a strong need for (model-based) automatic synthesis tools with integrated validationand veriﬁcation. For this reason, it seems more attractive touse model-based supervisor synthesis methods as discussedin [18]–[21], which have the following advantages:"

This DES is anabstraction of the physical component, as it does not describeits continuous behavior.

To evaluate the actual behavior of the systemvia simulation, a hybrid model is used that captures boththe discrete-event and continuous-time behavior of the sys-tem.

TheTwitter streaming API is limited to serving approximately 1%of the total volume of tweets generated in real time. Withonly a few occasional exceptions, mentioned in Section V,none of our channels have regularly exceeded this volume.To test the upper bound of available data, we conﬁgured achannel to collect geotagged tweets at a global level. Fig. 8shows that the global collection received notiﬁcation fromthe streaming API that the number of Tweets served up hadbeen rate limited. This demonstrates that the Sentinel pipelineis capable of dealing with the maximum volume of tweetsavailable from Twitter via the streaming API. The globalcollection was deployed on eight “m2.large” instances onour Openstack cloud. Each “m2.large” instance comprised of4-V CPUs, 16-GB RAM, and 160 GB of disk space."

These terms includednames of towns, streets, and landmarks (drawing upon policeand crime “hotspot” data) and names of key elements of thetransport systems (motorway junctions and railway stations).The channel was tuned at speciﬁc times in order to exam-ine periods of relatively high social disorder with particu-lar focus on public–police engagement; e.g., we introducedterms relating to Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night to studyimpacts of community–police relationships during the periodOctober 31 to November 5, 2014, which in recent years hasbeen characterized by a rise in antisocial behavior in the U.K.Owing to the long-term nature of the study, real-time“eyes-on” use of the apps was limited to speciﬁc periodswhen there was some expectation of activity, and episodic use"

One of the key ﬁndings was that, in termsof public services, the dominant issues on both channels tendto be travel-related. Partly, this seems to be because travelingusers are more prone to geotag their locations, causing Sentinelto collect their tweets within the channels’ respective boundingboxes, and partly it seems to be that venting one’s travel frus-trations is a common usage of Twitter.

The control-ﬂow errors mainly focus ondeadlock, livelock, soundness, and so on. However, there are nottoo many methods for detecting data-ﬂow errors. This paperdeﬁnes Petri nets with data operations (PN-DO) that can modelthe operations on data such as read, write and delete. Basedon PN-DO, we deﬁne some data-ﬂow errors in this paper. Weconstruct a reachability graph with data operations for eachPN-DO, and then propose a method to reduce the reachabilitygraph. Based on the reduced reachability graph, data-ﬂow errorscan be detected rapidly. A case study is given to illustrate theeffectiveness of our methods."
