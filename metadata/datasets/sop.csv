As previously mentioned,proper annotation of structurally similar isomers of cin-namic acid derivatives is a difficult task [9]. To avoid am-biguity during identification, using the IUPAC numberingsystem, we have considered all possible factors rangingfrom chromatographic separation to mass spectrometricbehaviour as shown in previously published data [10,12].In order to simplify identification, metabolites harboringcommon cinnamic acid moieties in their core structurewere monitored using a single mass extracted ion chro-matogram (XIC).

Possibly, the differences stemfrom different biochemical pathways leading to thebiosynthesis of CGA molecules in the two biologicalsystems.

In a previous research, the sequential use of ultrasonication, liquid hot water, and ligninolytic enzymes wasselected as pretreatment for the production of ethanol from CGT.

To accomplish that, this research evaluated the effect of pretreating CGT using alkaline ultrasonicationbefore a liquid hot water and ligninolytic enzymes pretreatments for ethanol production. Three NaOH concentrations(5%, 10%, and 15%) were employed for the alkaline ultrasonication.

In rice straw, the alkaliultrasonication exhibited cellulose conversion greaterthan the un-pretreated biomass and the alkali pretreat-ment; nevertheless, the difference between the alkali pre-treatment and the alkali ultrasonication was small [18].The cellulose conversion can be enhanced by differentstrategies such optimizing the severity of the liquid hotwater pretreatment or improving the conditions of theligninolytic enzymes and ultrasonication pretreatment(reaction time, temperatures, etc.).",s13

From these pre-treatments, the U-NaOH 15% + HW + E pretreatmentexhibited the highest cellulose conversion (41%) andethanol yield (64%). The use of FT-IR and principalcomponents was effective as a tool to identify the varia-tions in the signal of the cellulose, hemicellulose, andlignin from CGT after the different pretreatments. Add-itionally, the PCA could separate and identify the CGTbiomass from different types of pretreatments and iden-tify the signals with the most significant variation insidethe spectra.

This conclusion is further supported by the obser-vation that, after prenylation, acetylation of the remainingfree phenolic groups further reduced the cytotoxicity.",s15

Manglik et al. selectively targeted the Gi based μORpathway instead of the β‑arrestin pathway of the opioids. The computational screening of millions of compoundsshowed a list of several competent ligands. From these ligands they synthesized the compounds with the bestdocking score, which were further optimized by adding side residues for better interaction with the μOR. A promis‑ing compound, PZM21, was a selective agonist of μOR. It has better analgesic properties with minimal side effects ofrespiratory depression and constipation. This work is a step towards better drug designing and synthesizing in termsof efficacy, specificity with least side effects of targeted GPCR proteins present in the human proteome.",s18

In general, particles witha size less than 100 nm are referred to as nanoparticles.Entirely novel and enhanced characteristics such as size,distribution and morphology have been revealed by theseparticles in comparison to the larger particles of bulkmaterial [1]. Nanoparticles are gaining importance in theﬁelds of biology, medicine and electronics owing to theirunique physical and biological properties [2]. Among themetallic nanoparticles, Silver has been enormously utilizedfor its diverse applications in the ﬁelds of bio-labeling, optbiosensors, polarizing ﬁlters, electrical batteries, cancercell imaging, drug delivery systems etc. [3]. Silver has longtowardbeen recognized as having an inhibitory effectmany microorganisms [4] while it is not toxic to humancells in low concentrations [5].

We investigate whether these experts, drawn largely from the pharmaceutical industry andacademia, can match or exceed the predictive power of algorithms. Alongside this, we implement 10 typical machinelearning algorithms on the same dataset. The best algorithm, a variety of neural network known as a multi-layerperceptron, gave an RMSE of 0.985 log S units and an  R",s21

Wefound that, for either humans or algorithms, combining individual predictions into a consensus predictor by takingtheir median generated excellent predictivity. While our consensus human predictor achieved very slightly betterheadline figures on various statistical measures, the difference between it and the consensus machine learning pre-dictor was both small and statistically insignificant. We conclude that human experts can predict the aqueous solubil-ity of druglike molecules essentially equally well as machine learning algorithms. We find that, for either humans oralgorithms, combining individual predictions into a consensus predictor by taking their median is a powerful way ofbenefitting from the wisdom of crowds.",s21

Given  the  estimated  uncertainty  inavailable  experimental  data,  the  best  possible  predictorson  existing  data  might  achieve  RMSEs  around  0.6–0.7,though this figure is subject to debate, while a minimallyuseful predictor would be around 1.8 log S units for ourdataset.  Thus  the  current  state  of  prediction,  for  bothhumans and machines, is somewhat better than the mid-dle of the range between minimally useful and best realis-tically possible predictors.",s21

The increase in the conversion of ethyl-benzene with rise in temperature can be attributed to shiftin the equilibrium to the right favoring the forward reac-tion. The selectivity of styrene decreases with increase intemperature due to formation of higher amount of crackingand hydrogenolysis products such as benzene and toluene.It is interesting to observe that the selectivity of anilinemaintained maximum at all the reaction temperatures.,s23

In addition, they may antici-pate exchange paths in magnetic frameworks, especiallyin metal based materials. The nature of metal-ligandbonds is extremely important in one sector of crystalengineering, namely that of coordination polymers, andwill be discussed in section 3.

A newXCW approach was recently proposed by Genoni [99],who implemented the method for extremely localized mo-lecular orbital wave functions. An alternative way to esti-mate the crystal properties is however that of calculatingwith high accuracy the molecular quantities, then applyingcorrections for the perturbation of the crystal packing.For example, quite effective is the distributed atomicpolarizability approach to estimate linear optical proper-ties implemented in PolaBer [89]. The atomic polarizabil-ities can be used to calculate the electric susceptibility,through the anisotropic Lorentz approximation.

1,325,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,BODY,"Natural products represent a prominent source of pharmaceutically and industrially important agents. Calculatingthe chemical similarity of two molecules is a central task in cheminformatics, with applications at multiple stages ofthe drug discovery pipeline. Quantifying the similarity of natural products is a particularly important problem, as thebiological activities of these molecules have been extensively optimized by natural selection. The large and structur-ally complex scaffolds of natural products distinguish their physical and chemical properties from those of syntheticcompounds. However, no analysis of the performance of existing methods for molecular similarity calculation specificto natural products has been reported to date. Here, we present LEMONS, an algorithm for the enumeration of hypo-thetical modular natural product structures. We leverage this algorithm to conduct a comparative analysis of molecu-lar similarity methods within the unique chemical space occupied by modular natural products using controlledsynthetic data, and comprehensively investigate the impact of diverse biosynthetic parameters on similarity search.We additionally investigate a recently described algorithm for natural product retrobiosynthesis and alignment, andfind that when rule-based retrobiosynthesis can be applied, this approach outperforms conventional two-dimen-sional fingerprints, suggesting it may represent a valuable approach for the targeted exploration of natural productchemical space and microbial genome mining. Our open-source algorithm is an extensible method of enumeratinghypothetical natural product structures with diverse potential applications in bioinformatics.",s27

In general, the performance of eachsimilarity  search  method  was  similar  for  linear  hybridnatural  products  with  and  without  starter  units  (Addi-tional  file  3:  Fig.  S2).  However,  significant  differenceswere  observed  in  performance  when  comparing  starterunit  and  non-starter  unit  substitution:  for  instance,  thepercentage  of  natural  products  correctly  matched  by  thegraph-only CDK fingerprint was 16.22% higher for starterunit substitutions, but 30.47% lower for the Pubchem fin-gerprint.  Averaged  across  all  fingerprints,  a  starter  unitsubstitution was equivalent to 1.70 non-starter-unit sub-stitutions (Additional file 3: Fig. S2). These results suggestthat, in general, similarity search is strongly influenced bythe unique structural properties of modular natural prod-uct  starter  units.

During thisprocess the polymer is also refined from low-molecular sideproducts. Microcrystalline chitosan shows a number ofvaluable features as compared with unmodified chitosan:higher absorptivity, chelating capability, higher bioactivity,as well as ability of forming polymer films directly fromwater slurry.

Arsenic  can  be  detoxifiedby  methylation  process.  The  ability  of  bacteria  to  meth-ylate  arsenic  into  volatile  products  mainly  arsine,  in  theform  of  dimethylarsine,  is  already  known  (Bachofenet al. 1995). Mohapatra et al. (2008) have shown that cowdung  can  act  as  a  major  substrate  for  bacterial  growthduring  removal  of  arsenic  from  arsenic-rich  sludge  bymeans  of  volatilisation.  It  was  detected  that  methano-genic  bacteria  at  substrate,  i.e.,  cow  dung  concentrationof 25 mg/l, could effectively volatilise around 35 % arse-nic.  Dry  cow  dung  powder  has  recently  been  used  as  asource of adsorption for the removal of chromium fromaqueous  solution  and  achieved  73.8  %  removal  of  chro-mium  (Mohan  and  Gupta  2014).  Another  heavy  metal,i.e.,  radiotoxic  strontium  which  is  very  hazardous  dueto half-life of 29 years, imitates calcium in the body andincreases  the  risk  of  bone  cancer  and  leukaemia  (Peter-son  et  al.  2007;  Barot  and  Bagla  2012).

Meanwhile, wasted lubricating oil, a complexcomposition, presents high water content and exists withemulsion. A single technological method is difﬁcult to besatisﬁed for efﬁcient demulsiﬁcation and dehydration ofemulsiﬁed lubricating oil. In this paper, it is proposed thatthe swirl centrifugal ﬁeld made by hydrocyclone, pulseelectric ﬁeld, and vacuum temperature ﬁeld are coupled toachieve the oil’s dehydration. Based on the theories, it isreasonable to use three ﬁelds for oil’s demulsiﬁcation. Inthe experiment of three-ﬁeld dehydrating, the demulsiﬁ-cation device is divided into two parts, namely, the coupledunit of pulse electric ﬁeld and hydrocyclone, and the vac-uum heating unit. The structure and size of the device wereoptimized through numerical simulation. With two modesof single ﬁeld and three-ﬁeld, the experiments were carriedout. Results indicated that the use of three-ﬁeld was moreenergy efﬁcient and faster compared with the traditionalvacuum heating method only.",s30

Under the action of centrifugal force, thedroplets gather near the wall, move toward the underﬂowexit, and are ﬁnally expelled. As the oil moves toward thehydrocyclone’s central axis, a centronucleus is formed,ﬂows to the entrance direction, and is expelled from theoverﬂow port [19]. Oil–water is separated through thisprocess. In hydrocyclone, the oil droplets are subjected toviscous shear stress, Reynolds shear stress, and Magnusforce [20]. Numerical simulation is used to study oil/waterseparation properties because the ﬂow ﬁeld is compara-tively complex [21]. Based on large eddy simulation the-ory,in thelocus ofhydrocyclone can be obtained with the following formula.The separation efﬁciency of hydrocyclone can be effec-tively estimated by analyzing the movement locus [22].",s30

Underthe effect of screw pump, solid impurities (such as metalparticles and sand) in oil can be ﬁltered through thestrainer. The emulsion droplets from the strainer coalesceand increase in size because the pulse electric ﬁeld isfused in the hydrocyclone, and the oil–water separationis rapidly accomplished under the effect of the swirlfrom the overﬂow port ofcentrifugal ﬁeld.

Instead of the use of gravity ﬁeldfor the droplet settling, the hydrocyclone ﬁeld can be usedto rapidly and efﬁciently separate oil and big emulsiondroplets, thereby considerably shortening the dehydrationtime. The vacuum heating ﬁeld can dehydrate tiny emul-sion droplets in oil. At present, vacuum heating is the onlyphysical method that can be used to achieve a high dehy-dration degree of the emulsiﬁed oil. When the high-voltagepulse electric ﬁeld, swirl centrifugal ﬁeld by hydrocyclone,and vacuum heating ﬁeld are integrated, the original singletreatment process can be modiﬁed and a new demulsiﬁ-cation and dehydration technology of emulsiﬁed lubricat-ing oil is achieved.

Different authors have provided different explana-tions  for  the  pesticidal  properties  of  the  vermicompostwhich  basically  revolve  around  two  conjectures:  betternutrient availability hence greater vitality in warding offinfection, and presence of pathogen-destroying microor-ganisms  (Arancon  et  al.  2005;  2008;  Yardim  et  al.  2006;Cardoza  2011;  Singh  et  al.  2013;  Xiao  et  al.  2016).  Thepresent  studies  indicate  that  the  vermicompost  of  par-thenium  is  also  imbibed  with  a  similar  attribute.  Paststudies  on  manure-based  vermicompost  have  indicatedthat  better  nutrient  availability  and  presence  of  antimi-crobial  compounds  such  as  flavonoids,  phenolics,  andhumic acids in the vermicompost may have induced theresistance to pathogens in the plants (Graham and Webb1991;  Hill  et  al.  1999;  Haviola  et  al.  2007;  Sahni  et  al.",s31

However, there is difficulty for quanti-fication of caffeine in aqueous solution of coffee beans usingthe emission property due to strong overlapping. Therefore,to  overcome  this  difficulty  it  is  necessary  to  quantify  theamount  of  caffeine  using  the  excitation  intensity.  Hence,fluorescent compounds can be identified or quantified onthe basis of their excitation or emission properties. The flu-orescence excitation intensity versus wavelength spectrumof standard caffeine is shown in Fig. 6.",s32

Therefore,a  quantitative  determination  of  caffeine  in  green  coffeebeans  become  feasible  by  employing  the  present  pro-posed  spectroscopic  methods  with  simple,  short  timeof  analysis  and  inexpensive  procedure.  In  addition  themethods  have  been  tested  for  roasted  coffee  beans  andare applicable with the same procedure. These analyticalmethods may therefore, be recommended for the rapid,simple, safe and cost effective determination of caffeinein coffee beans.",s32

In previous studies, two mechanisms were presented,dual cycle mechanism and alkene cycle mechanism.According to the dual cycle mechanism, ethylene andpropylene are mainly produced through the cracking ofaromatic intermediates, which are generated in the pres-ence of strong acid sites. And propene is additionallyproduced from the cracking of higher oleﬁn in the alkenecycles [27]. Low number of strong acid sites reduced theamount of active aromatic intermediates, and then loweredthe yield of ethylene, but the relatively rapid progress ofthe alkene cycle might cause a high yield of propene. Thedeclination of ethylene and the increase of propylene in thisexperiment could be explained by the reduction of strongacid sites, which was necessary for the formation of aro-matic intermediates.

The effect of urea/metal ratios on the metal oxidedispersion, the conversion of the metal precursor to oxideand the structure and catalyst performance for diesel HDShas been studied. It is shown that the addition of urea adjuststhe metal–support interaction, leading to the easy reductionof the metal oxide over the catalyst surface. It also changesthe surface cluster of the oxide and the oxide structure. Theaddition of urea to metal matrix signiﬁcantly improves thecatalytic diesel HDS performance and increases the catalyststability. The urea to Ni metal ratio of 2 gives the highestsulfur removal rate in the real diesel HDS process.",s34

The aim of thisresearch is to identify energy efﬁciency opportunities at theenergy management resources in a petrochemical industry.It was proved that using MILP makes it possible to achieveenergy efﬁciency gains. MILP proved to be effective,accurate and robust. It conﬁrmed the importance of mod-eling and simulation with quick response and its imple-mentation in a higher possible rate, since the potentialgains running the model once per day were 81% higherthan performing it once a month. The optimal resourceschoice had an average annual potential saving of US$556.000/year.",s35

This  leads  to  an  obviousquestion:  what  do  we  consider  cheminformatics?  Ananswer  to  this  allows  us  to  judge  where  innovation  lies.Very broadly, cheminformatics addresses the generation,representation  and  manipulation  of  chemical  informa-tion,  with  the  chemical  structure  at  its  foundation.  Andthus  innovation  can  occur  at  multiple  levels,  startingfrom  the  chemical  structure  itself  (non-graph  represen-tations,  learned  representations)  to  novel  ways  to  inte-grate  chemical  information  with  other  data  types  (such",s39

1,273,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,AU,Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is usually determined by estimation of iothalamate (IOT) clearance. We have devel-oped and validated an accurate and robust method for the analysis of IOT in human plasma and urine. The mobilephase consisted of methanol and 50 mM sodium phosphate (10:90; v/v). Flow rate was 1.2 mL/min on a C18 reverse,s40

The recoveries of IOT in urine and plasma ranged between 93.14% and114.74 and 96.04–118.38%, respectively. The linear range for urine and plasma assays were 25–1500 and 1–150 µg/mL respectively. The lower limits of detection were 0.5 µg/mL for both urine and plasma, with no interference fromplasma and urine matices. This method has been fully validated according to FDA guidelines and the new HPLC assayhas been applied to a new formulation of IOT (Conray",s40

Inulin[4, 5] and creatinine [6, 7] clearances are accepted refer-ence  standards  for  determining  GFR  but  are  expensiveand  laborious.  Colorimetric  assays  are  used  to  detectInulin, which is very expensive and also in very short sup-ply and many problems with the assay [8]. 24-h creatinineclearance overestimates GFR in patients with poor renalfunction  and  a  variety  of  other  glomerular  diseases  anddrugs  can  make  creatinine  clearance  and  serum  creati-nine a poor markers of GFR estimation [9, 10]. GFR esti-mated from serum creatinine using prediction equationsmay  result  in  unpredictable  error  when  the  diagnosisof  chronic  kidney  disease  is  unknown  [1–3,  6,  7,  11–23].

To deal with the depletion of fossil energy andenvironmental issues caused by the released carbon dioxide,biofuel was considered as one of the proposed solutions tosubstitute the usage of fossil fuel [1]. Generally, the biofuelgenerated from lignocellulose conversion had attracted moreattentions [2]. The sawdust is an abundant residual forestbiomass, which has not been utilized and is usually burneddirectly, leading to energy waste and environmental pollu-tion. Thus, it is necessary to convert the residual to obtainbio-oil or useful chemicals through process techniques.",s41

Asshown in Fig. 3, the gaseous yield increased gradually inthe whole residence time. It could be explained thatdecomposition of large bio-oil molecule occurred at alonger time.

Different  from  pre-vious  relation  extraction  tasks  such  as  protein–proteininteraction,  disease-gene  association,  and  miRNA-geneinteraction [23, 25, 28–32, 44], the BC5 task requires theoutput of extracted relations with entities normalized to acontrolled vocabulary (the National Library of Medicine’sMedical Subject Headings (MeSH) identifiers were used).Furthermore, one should extract such a list of <ChemicalID, Disease ID> pairs from the entire PubMed documentand  many  relations  may  be  described  across  sentences[53].  For  instance,  Fig.  1  shows  the  title  and  abstract  ofa  document  (PMID  2375138)  with  two  CID  relations<D008874,  D006323>  and  <D008874,  D012140>.  Whilethe  former  relation  (“midazolam”  and  “cardiorespiratoryarrest”) is in the same sentence, the latter relation (“mida-zolam”  and  “respiratory  and  cardiovascular  depression”)is not. Moreover, not all pairs of chemicals and diseasesare  involved  in  a  CID  relation.  For  instance,  there  is  norelation  between  “midazolam”  and  “death”  in  Fig.  1because  the  task  guidelines  consider  “death”  to  be  toogeneral.",s42

A large number of international teams par-ticipated  and  achieved  the  best  performance  of  57.07in  F-score  for  the  CID  relation  extraction  task.  In  thiswork, we aim to improve the best results obtained in thechallenge  by  combining  a  rich-feature  machine  learn-ing  approach  with  additional  training  data  obtainedwithout additional annotation cost from existing entriesin  curated  databases.  We  demonstrate  the  feasibil-ity  of  converting  the  abundant  manual  annotations  inbiomedical  databases  into  labeled  instances  that  canbe  readily  used  by  supervised  machine-learning  algo-rithms. Our work therefore joins a few other studies indemonstrating  the  use  of  the  curated  knowledge  freelyavailable in biomedical databases for assisting text-min-ing tasks [17, 46, 48].",s42
2,982,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,BODY,"More specifically, we formulate the relation extractiontask  as  a  classification  task  on  chemical-disease  pairs.Our  classification  model  is  based  on  Support  VectorMachine  (SVM).  It  uses  a  set  of  rich  features  that  com-bine the advantages of rule-based and statistical methods.While relation extraction tasks were first tackled usingsimple  methods  such  as  co-occurrence,  lately  moreadvanced  machine  learning  systems  have  been  investi-gated due to the increasing availability of annotated cor-pora [52]. Typically, the relation extraction task has beenconsidered  as  a  classification  problem.  For  each  pair,useful  information  from  NLP  tools  including  part-of-speech taggers, full parsers, and dependency parsers wereextracted as features [20, 56]. In the BioCreative V, severalmachine learning models have been explored for the CIDtask,  including  Naïve  Bayes  [30],  maximum  entropy  [14,19],  logistic  regression  [21],  and  support  vector  machine(SVM).  In  general,  the  use  of  SVM  has  achieved  betterperformance [53]. One of the highest-performing systemswas proposed by Xu et al. [55] with two independent SVMmodels,  sentence-level  and  document-level  classifiers  forthe CID task. We instead combined the feature vector onboth  the  sentence  and  document  level  and  developed  aunified model.

Specifi-cally,  we  make  use  of  previously  curated  data  in  CTDas  additional  training  data.  Unlike  the  fully  annotatedBC5  corpus,  these  additional  training  data  are  weaklylabeled:  CID  relations  are  linked  to  the  source  articlesin  PubMed  (i.e.  document-level  annotations)  but  theactual appearances of the disease and chemicals in therelation are not labeled in the article (i.e. mention-levelannotations  are  absent).  Hence  they  are  not  directlyapplicable  and  have  to  be  repurposed  when  used  fortraining  our  machine-learning  algorithm.  Supervisedmachine-learning  approaches  require  annotated  train-ing data which may be difficult to obtain in large scale.To  acquire  training  data,  people  have  recently  studiedvarious  methods  using  unlabeled  or  weakly  labeleddata [6, 37, 48, 57, 58].

A number of patent chemistry data-bases generated by using the latter approach are now available but little is known that can help to manage expecta-tions when using them.

For  compounds  annotated  with  “Bio-logical  Studies”  in  SciFinder  the  overlap  is  only  5  %.This prompts the question of how to identify the rel-evant  compounds  amongst  what  one  could  call  arte-facts  or  noise  (e.g.  reagents,  intermediates,  solvents,radicals,  fragments,  reference  compounds,  and  exist-ing marketed drugs). A SureChEMBL annotation thatcan  help  to  address  this  challenge  is  the  “chemicalcorpus  count”.  It  is  the  count  of  the  number  of  occa-sions  a  chemical  structure  has  been  observed  withinthe whole currently available chemical corpus of Sure-ChEMBL.  Figure  2  shows  how  the  compounds  fromthe subset of 35 patents, for which in SciFinder com-pounds  with  the  annotation  “Biological  Studies”  canbe  found,  are  distributed  across  different  ranges  ofchemical  corpus  count.  As  can  be  seen,  approx.  90  %of  the  compounds  have  a  chemical  corpus  count  ofless than or equal to 30. At the same time, only 16 % ofall molecules found in SureChEMBL for the 35 patentshave a chemical corpus count less than or equal to 30.Hence, applying a filter of chemical corpus count",s45

However, discrimination of these models onstatistical and thermodynamic grounds revealed that themodel representing a single-site dissociative adsorption ofmethane and steam most adequately explained the data.However, the product formation rates from these experi-ments were reasonably captured by power-law model. Theparameter estimates from the power-law model revealed anorder of 0.94 with respect to methane and",s46

Further, in thisstudy, we have used the methane consumption data fromexperiments carried out in our previous study [22] andevaluated in terms of the formal LH and ER models todetermine MSR mechanism over 1 wt.% Ce/10 wt.% Ni/SBA-15. In this investigation, the mechanistic models wereproposed using reaction pathways that are deﬁned by themost abundant reactive intermediates (MARI) which areconverted into products through surface reaction over theone or more catalyst active sites [6, 23–25]. Nevertheless,mechanistic model based on single-site dissociativeadsorption of methane and steam adequately captured therate behaviour on the Ce/Ni/SBA-15 catalyst.",s46

Bioremediation  is  a  way  of  cleaning  up  heavymetals  using  biomass  (or  microorganisms)  through  theprocesses  of  biodegradation,  biosorption,  bioaccumu-lation  and  bioconversion  operating  in  different  ways(Kulshreshtha  et  al.  2014;  Mosa  et  al.  2016). The  micro-organisms  bind  to  heavy  metals  and  concentrate  them(Joutey et al. 2015). Biosorption is a passive process andheavy metals get adsorbed on the surface of the biosorb-ent (Velásquez and Dussan 2009) exhibiting the toleranceof biosorbent towards heavy metals. The mechanisms likeextracellular  (chelation  and  cell  wall  binding)  and  intra-cellular (binding to compounds like proteins) sequestra-tion of heavy metals have been proposed as mechanismsfor  heavy  metals  tolerance  in  fungi  (Fawzy  et  al.  2017).Biosorbent  from  mushrooms  can  be  prepared  frommycelium  or  fruit  body  (live  or  dead)  and  spent  mush-room  substrate  (SMS).
