Manglik et al. selectively targeted the Gi based μORpathway instead of the β‑arrestin pathway of the opioids. The computational screening of millions of compoundsshowed a list of several competent ligands. From these ligands they synthesized the compounds with the bestdocking score, which were further optimized by adding side residues for better interaction with the μOR. A promis‑ing compound, PZM21, was a selective agonist of μOR. It has better analgesic properties with minimal side effects ofrespiratory depression and constipation. This work is a step towards better drug designing and synthesizing in termsof efficacy, specificity with least side effects of targeted GPCR proteins present in the human proteome.",s18
