e18,4620,One of the main points of the proposed method was thedilution of the used lubricating oils with a convenient solvent inorder to decrease the viscosity of the samples and permit theiremulsi ﬁ cation. Toluene was chosen for this purpose and a volu-metric percentage of 20% v/v of solvent was enough to give stableemulsions.

However, content-based recom-mendation systems have many drawbacks with regard toLBSNs: 1) content-based recommendation systems do not con-sider the aggregated community opinions (inferred from users),which may result in low-quality recommendations; and 2)content-based recommendation systems require that the struc-tured information for both users and locations be created andmaintained, which can be costly, especially in LBSNs in whichthe majority of the content (such as user proﬁles and loca-tion tags) is generated by the users. information about users. In real time, user information dataare huge, so we are going to analyse a recommender systemwith big data. Data in a data warehouse are unmodiﬁed andconsistent. Data formats are standardised through data ware-house to generate reports, and dashboards to forecast trendsand predict the future. In data warehouse, data are inte-grated and provide interactive tools to users. Datasets for rec-ommender systems play an important in LBSN to providerecommendations to users. To provide recommendation, datahave to be available any time and need to be distributed. Ourobjective is to analyse whether data warehouse or big datais better for recommender systems. This can be done in twoways: qualitative and quantitative. Our analysis was quali-tative, based on few parameters such as parallel processingand multimodal interface."

Similarly, we frequently observe that theconstructs/variables are sometimes capitalised and at othertimes they are not. Two things are key in this respect. First,the guidelines of the journal to which the manuscript is sub-mitted should dictate what to do. Second, if the journal guide-lines are not clear whether to capitalise or not to capitaliseheadings/subheadings and constructs/variables, the authorsneed to make a decision on what they want to do and thendo it uniformly. statements. The arguments may lack sharpness and preci-sion. The reader is presented with concepts, jargon, and ac-ronyms that are not deﬁned or are used inconsistently in themanuscript. One of the reasons this may happen is becausethe authors are too close to the material and fail to put them-selves in the shoes of the reader (Ragins, 2012); the authorsget too wrapped up in their ideas and lose their perspectiveof what is primarily important and what is less important forthe purpose of the manuscript."

Also, describingthe methods and procedures is a more routine task. Whateverthe reason, lack of clear and full description of methods leavesreviewers confused.
