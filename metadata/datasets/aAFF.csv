1,274,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,AFF,"Transfer learning has gained a lot of attention and interest in the past decade. One crucial research issuein transfer learning is how to find a good representation for instances of different domains such that thedivergence between domains can be reduced with the new representation. Recently, deep learning has beenproposed to learn more robust or higher-level features for transfer learning. In this article, we adapt the au-toencoder technique to transfer learning and propose a supervised representation learning method basedon double encoding-layer autoencoder. The proposed framework consists of two encoding layers: one forembedding and the other one for label encoding. In the embedding layer, the distribution distance of theembedded instances between the source and target domains is minimized in terms of KL-Divergence. In thelabel encoding layer, label information of the source domain is encoded using a softmax regression model.Moreover, to empirically explore why the proposed framework can work well for transfer learning, we pro-pose a new effective measure based on autoencoder to compute the distribution distance between differentdomains. Experimental results show that the proposed new measure can better reflect the degree of transferdifficulty and has stronger correlation with the performance from supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Lo-gistic Regression), compared with previous ones, such as KL-Divergence and Maximum Mean Discrepancy.Therefore, in our model, we have incorporated two distribution distance measures to minimize the differencebetween source and target domains in the embedding representations. Extensive experiments conducted onthree real-world image datasets and one text data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodcompared with several state-of-the-art baseline methods.",a50
