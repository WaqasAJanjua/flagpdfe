i37,6777,"relatively less increase ( + 18%) in rainfall. Gauged and sim-ulated discharges agree well with each other during the cali-bration and validation periods, with the gauged precipitationand 3B42V7 as precipitation forcing. TMPA-3B42V7 prod-uct shows comparable hydrologic utility with the referenceprecipitation in hydrological prediction at Shehong basin.Monthly model runoff estimates show considerable agree-ment with gauge observations recorded at Shehong station,indicating CREST model can capture the soil moisture stor-age variability. Change in storage patterns (the sum of changein storage is close to zero) indicate that CREST modelreproduces the water cycle processes at Shehong basin withacceptable skills. In terms of water balance reconstructionresults, the model is proven to be beneﬁcial in address-ing issues pertaining to sustainability of water resourceswithin the catchment with respectto model robustnessand effectiveness. Therefore, Satellite precipitation prod-ucts help to understand the potential hydrological utility of remote sensing data for hydrological modelling studies in ungauged or poorly gauged basins. As retrospectively pro- cessed GPM-era IMERG datasets are released, more studies to simulate the key hydrological processes and reconstruct the water budget are required in the future."

The throughputincreases quickly when the network is partially loaded. Mean-while, as shown in Fig. 8, the throughput achieves differentvalues at different SIR thresholds when other parametersare the same. This is because lower can provide greatercoverage probability but will reduce the spectrum efﬁciency,and vice versa. The larger threshold can guarantee morethroughput when the number of SBSs is larger. However,a relatively small threshold should be chosen when thereare not as many SBSs to achieve better performance."

Section III presentsan analysis of a large tag dataset from three different but related perspectives. First, tag co-occurrence patterns are analysed and our ﬁndings are presented in Section III-A. Second, we validatethe dataset labels and discuss the effects of label noise on neu-ral network training and evaluation in Section III-B. We thenassess the capacity of the trained network to represent musicalknowledge in terms of similarity between predicted labels and co-occurrences between ground truth labels in Section III-C."
