i22,9596,"In the experiment, we used theDragon Stack, a cloud server hosted in Xidian University asthe public cloud. It was responsible for executing the Hadoopapplications (the PWL) and collecting the execution logs. Thecloud server was set up with two Intel Xeon E5 CPU (6 coreson each CPU), 128 GB of memory and 6 TB of hard diskstorage. We chose XenServer 6.2 as the cloud hypervisor.On this server, we deployed a Hadoop cluster consisting ofﬁve Linux virtual machines. Each virtual machine used Ubuntu14.04.1 and was conﬁgured with one core of CPU, 2 GB ofmemory and 128 GB of storage. We also set up a privatecloud to perform the execution audition. The private cloudserver was set up with two Intel Xeon E5 CPU (8 cores oneach CPU), 128 GB of memory and 3 TB of hard disk storage.We chose KVM 2.0.0 as the cloud hypervisor. On the privatecloud, we set up one Linux virtual machine, conﬁgured as8 cores of CPU, 8 GB of memory and 512 GB of storage. In this set of experiments, PPWC processes the same dataas Word Count application. However, data are processedin ciphertexts. Due to the repeated execution of encryptionfunction (such as AH_add in Listing 2), the execution time oforiginal PPWC is 2.54 times of Word Count. When the PWLof PPWC was executed on the public cloud, it incurred 34.34%of performance overhead compared to the original PPWC, andgenerates 46.3 GB of logs, in which 14 GB are the invocationlogs for the encryption functions."

i26,2718,"the first long heater demonstration was in houston,texas. i n a well called Horizontal 4 ( HZ4 ), a 518-m(1,700  ft)-long  pipe-in-pipe  heater  was  installed  hori-zontally  450  m  (1,500  ft)  below  the  surface,  as  shown in figure 6. with a resistance of approxima tely 2 Ω, the device  required  nearly 630 a to achieve 1,100 w/m(350 w/ft) on  the  heater.  including  overburden  loss-es, the 1,100-v power supply total load approached700  kw.  following  the  precedence  of  shorter  heatertests, an scr fed by an isolation transformer was chosenas  the  power  supply.  this  quickly  led  to  a  case  of  Mvsticker shock."

i26,2983,"the  idea  for  a  modified  regulator  as  a  replacementcontroller  for  hZ4  was  revisited  and  given  approval  fortesting.  the  833-kva  unit  shown  in  figure  7  was  pro-duced at a cost of us$35,000. Because of an aggressiveschedule, there was no time to program a supervisoryPlc, and the test was run with a modified regulator con-troller alone."
