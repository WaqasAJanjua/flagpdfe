a12,1884,"Both music-based and environmental sounds can be entertaining and can includedramatized and emotional content. However, in their simplest forms, neither of thesesound types are well-suited to convey much information at the same time. Further, inthe case of musical sounds, the listener has to learn the abstract mappings betweensound and information; however, in the case of environmental sounds, the existence of apriori connotations often restricts the designer’s ability to create free associations. Mu-sical effects, short musical events, environmental sound events, or simple instrumentscan be used for iconic representations, but only with limitation."

a13,994,"As one of the most important digital footprints, user-uploaded geotagged photosrecord people’s actual presences and their activities at speciﬁc locations in the phys-ical world [Jiang et al. 2015]. With this insight, recent research efforts [Shen et al. 2014, 2016] have been dedicated to providing online travel guidance services such aspersonalized Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation based upon the geotagged pho-tos. In real life, users are often overwhelmed by the countless POIs when arriving ina new city. To minimize the matching gap, personalized POI recommendation workstoward routing the most appropriate POIs to the right persons by taking their personalpreferences encoded in their historical photos into account."
a13,2445,"(1) We harvest a set of rich cues including photo uploading records, user favoringbehaviors, as well as preference degrees to enhance the personalized POI rec-ommendation performance. The unique nature of the cues allows us to gain acomprehensive understanding of user preferences on various POIs. To the best ofour knowledge, we are the ﬁrst authors to provide a set of such cues."

a16,5590,"Among the studies that have been done on SLAM within the cloud-based system, it isclearly mentioned that cloud service providers continuously need to adapt the networksituation and changing demands of customers to avoid violations during service deliv-ery that may affect the agreed SLA. Table II provides some salient points with regardto cloud SLAM to maintain service delivery. Reconﬁguring the resources to supportservice continuity is what was suggested by most reference works. However, consider-ing that available resources are limited, SLA renegotiation is advised as well. Servicesthat are maintained and evolve regularly can lead to fewer service level violations.Such violations may reduce trust with regard to the cloud provider."

a17,12828,"The goal of our ﬁrst research question is to investigate how much redundancy exists inthe execution traces of real concurrent programs. To generate the data necessary forinvestigating this question, we proceed as follows. For each benchmark, we ﬁrst run itmultiple times with different inputs and the number of threads, and used PECAN tocollect the corresponding trace of each run. For each trace, we then apply our techniqueto produce a ﬁltered trace with the redundancy removed. As our technique deals withtwo dimensions of redundancy (the local redundancy and the global redundancy), wemeasured the percentage of redundant events with respect to the local and globalredundancy, respectively."

For example, according to a survey among software developersat Microsoft in 2005, the fraction of software developers who use unit tests was 79%.When a project uses unit tests, it often uses a lot of them. For example, it is reportedthat in many projects within Microsoft the production code is smaller than its unittests [Tillmann and Schulte 2006b]."

a21,1416,"A key feature of H is bounding of regular and context-free languages. Boundingmakes H different from custom string-constraint solvers commonly used in testingand analysis tools [Emmi et al. 2007]. As we demonstrate in our experiments, formany practical applications, bounding the input languages is not a handicap. In fact,it allows for a more expressive input language that enables operations on context-freelanguages that would be undecidable without bounding. Furthermore, bounding makesthe satisﬁability problem solved by H more tractable. This difference is analogousto that between model-checking and bounded model-checking [Biere et al. 2003]."

a26,2445,"Switzerland, whose latest design document (version 0.3) dates back to 2008, is apassive bilateral technique [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)]. Switzerland looksfor lost, modiﬁed, and injected packets in a ﬂow between a pair of hosts. It does sousing a central server to which both hosts report the cryptographic hashes of sent andreceived packets along with the time when the packets were observed. The server thenlooks at the packets in search of anomalies. It searches for packets that were receivedwith a hash different from the hash reported during transmission, which indicatesmodiﬁed packets. It also looks for packets injected by the network, that is, packetsthat the receiver reports but the sender does not. Lastly, it counts dropped packetsby comparing the number of packets observed by the receiver and comparing it to thenumber of packets sent. The design of Switzerland is not complete and the project seems to have been abandoned."

Apparently, this is because fewer high prioritypackets meant that the scheduler could service the low priority class longer. The lossrates of the different classes are shown in Table II.

a26,15578,"PPrate does have some drawbacks stemming from its passive approach. As PPrateuses one-sided packet traces for capacity estimation, it is forced to guess which packetswere sent back to back, and therefore can be used as samples; mistakes in these guessescould lead to large inaccuracies. CONNEcT avoids the guesswork by passing packettimestamps between the two sides."
a27,1256,"Data uncertainty is inherent in the applications above. In a wireless network, theconnection between two mobile devices may or may not be established, as factors such as signal interference and antenna power may affect the connection of devices [Ghosh et al. 2007]. Due to hardware limitations, measurement errors also occur in biologicaldatabases (e.g., protein-to-protein interaction [Asthana et al. 2004]) and road monitor-ing systems (e.g., trafﬁc congestion data [Hua and Pei 2010]). In a graph that depictsthe relationship of authors of Wikipedia entries, the existence of edges may not bedeﬁnite. As another example, viral marketing techniques [Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg2007] study the purchase behavior of users in a social network. A directed edge fromMary to John, for example, indicates that John’s purchases are inﬂuenced by thoseof Mary. This is unlikely to be a deterministic relationship, for John may not alwaysfollow Mary’s purchase behavior [Adar and Re 2007]. Querying these graphs withoutconsidering this uncertainty information can lead to incorrect answers."

In addition, it also jointly learns the task-sharing and task-speciﬁcfeatures via lasso and graph-guided fused lasso. The graph-structure is constructed byleveraging the external and internal knowledge. We relaxed the non-smooth objectivefunction to a smooth one and derived its optimization process. To validate our proposedmodel, we crawled ground truth, short texts, check-ins, and images from four prevail-ing sources, namely Linkedin, Twitter, Foursquare, and Instagram. Representativefeatures were extracted from these sources to characterize users from various views.Extensive experiments on this dataset show the priority of our model to the baselines.It is worth mentioning that our model is ﬂexible to incorporate more sources and it is applicable to infer other attributes beyond occupations."

Because clocksare associated with timed process constructs, it implies that for every abstract con-ﬁguration ( , , ), ( ) is ﬁnite. By reusing clocks (as in Deﬁnition 4.2), it impliesthat only ﬁnitely many clocks are necessary. Last, notice that all abstract ﬁring rulespreserve parameters of timed process constructs and therefore the possible valuesfor parameters is ﬁnite. Finally, # is ﬁnite."

Many of the articles contain tables,such as the one shown in Figure 1, which contains some interesting attributes of the planets in oursolar system. The first column, Planet, lists the entities of this table and it can be considered thetable’s primary key."
a43,16504,"We also observe that the use of multi-hashing is not always outperforming configurations withonly one bit-signature per input column, that is, the top 10 results for WDCWebTables1 containsolely parametrizations with p ≤ 3 , and six times only was one pass applied. However, almost allworst configuration settings only use p = 1 and the smallest value for m . With this observation, wemight not be able to guess the best parametrization for Many in advance, but we can easily avoidthe worst runtimes shown in Figure 9 by setting m > 100 and p > 1. For the following evaluations,we chose for each dataset the best available parametrization."

a49,450,Fault localization can be used to prioritize the statements of a program according tothe likelihood that each contains a fault that causes a known failure [Jones et al. 2002;Renieres and Reiss 2003]. Regression test prioritization is used to order statementsaccording to early achievement of some testing goal such as coverage [Elbaum et al.2000; Li et al. 2007; Rothermel et al. 2001; Yoo and Harman 2012].
