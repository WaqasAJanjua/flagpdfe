s21,8729,"Both these results lead to the conclusion that machinelearning algorithms and human experts predict aqueoussolubility  essentially  equally  well.  The  machine  learn-ers  had  access  to  over  a  hundred  descriptors  for  eachcompound,  essentially  infallible  memory,  and  the  abil-ity to implement intricately designed algorithmic proce-dures with fast and precise numerical calculations. Thusit  is  perhaps  surprising  that  they  were  unable  to  out-perform  humans  at  this  task.  Our  experiences  with  thisstudy,  however,  suggest  that  the  prediction  of  solubilityfor more than around 25 molecules in one sitting wouldbecome  an  onerous  task  for  most  humans,  whereas  acomputer  is  unlikely  to  complain  if  asked  to  make  pre-dictions  for  a  thousand  compounds.  Thus,  our  experi-mental  design  was  somewhat  contrived  to  minimise  themachines’ inherent advantage of an essentially unlimitedattention span."

Gene cloning was performed in E. coli DH5α and B.  subtilis strain  PT5  containing  the  T7  RNA  polymer-ase for gene expression driven by the T7 promoter (Chenet al. 2010). For DNA manipulation, E. coli were grown in10 mL of Luria–Bertani (LB) medium in a 125-mL shakeflask,  and  cell  densities  were  determined  through  theoptical density at 600 nm  (OD 600 ). For keratinase produc-tion,  recombinant B.  subtilis strains  were  cultured  over-night at 37 °C and inoculated into a 250-mL shake flaskcontaining fresh LB medium (30 mL) with cell density ofOD 600 = 0.1,  and  then  incubated  in  an  orbital  shaker  at200  rpm  and  37  °C  for  24  h.  For  the  selection  of E.  coli harboring plasmids or B. subtilis integrants, the mediumwas supplanted with antibiotics ampicillin (50 µg/L for E.coli ) and erythromycin (10 µg/L for B. subtilis )."

s29,450,"In India, 69.9 % population resides in rural areas (TheHindu 2011), where cow ( Bos indicus ) is major cattle andgenerates 9–15 kg dung/day (Werner et al. 1989; Brown2003). Waste is generally meant for discarding because itmay  act  as  a  source  of  pollution  (Pongrácz  and  Pohjola2004). However, if it is used in some other process suchas feedstock it may be considered as co-product (Brown2003).  People  in  Indian  villages  use  cow  dung  for  cook-ing purpose by direct burning. It is also used in plasteringof walls and floor in rural houses for providing insulationduring winter and summer. Application of smoke gener-ated from the burnt cow dung as mosquito repellent andsubsequent  ash  as  cleaning  agent  for  kitchen  utensils  isan  age  old  practice.  Accordingly,  different  usage  of  cowdung  by  village  peoples  reflect  the  native  knowledgeassociated with it. It also depict that cow plays an impor-tant role in village economy and has high socio-economicvalue (Dhama et al. 2005a)."

This region experiences hot summers, with maximum day tem-perature  35–38  °C,  during  March–July  and  mild  wintersduring  December–February  (maximum  day  temperature29–32 °C). The average annual rainfall is about 1300 mm,concentrated mainly during October–December but witha  few  rainy  days  occurring  in  July–August  and  Januaryas  well.  The  study  was  conducted  during  February–Maywhich  is  ideal  for  growing  ladies  finger  in  the  study  area(ICAR  2011).  The  vermicompost  used  in  the  experimentwas  produced  from  parthenium  leaves,  which  were  col-lected  from  the  vicinity  of  Pondicherry  University  cam-pus. The leaves were washed to remove the adhering soiland subjected to the earthworm species Eisenia foetida inpulse-fed, high-rate vermireactors, as detailed by Nayeem-Shah (2014), and Nayeem-Shah et al. (2015). There was nopre-composting or any manure supplementation. The ver-micast  was  periodically  harvested  in  each  pulse  and  thisprecisely  quantifiable  product  of  the  earthworm  actionwas  deemed  as  vermicompost  (Abbasi  et  al.  2009,  2015).The characteristics of the vermicompost are detailed ear-lier by Hussain et al.

s40,471,"Renal  function  is  best  studied  with  accurate  measure-ment  of  glomerular  filtration  rate  (GFR)  in  pre-clinicalstudies,  clinical  practice  and  clinical  trials  [1–3].  Inulin[4, 5] and creatinine [6, 7] clearances are accepted refer-ence  standards  for  determining  GFR  but  are  expensiveand  laborious.  Colorimetric  assays  are  used  to  detectInulin, which is very expensive and also in very short sup-ply and many problems with the assay [8]. 24-h creatinineclearance overestimates GFR in patients with poor renalfunction  and  a  variety  of  other  glomerular  diseases  anddrugs  can  make  creatinine  clearance  and  serum  creati-nine a poor markers of GFR estimation [9, 10]. GFR esti-mated from serum creatinine using prediction equationsmay  result  in  unpredictable  error  when  the  diagnosisof  chronic  kidney  disease  is  unknown  [1–3,  6,  7,  11–23].

Initial methods for sample prepara-tion consisted of several time-consuming extraction andevaporation  steps.  Also,  the  sensitivity  of  some  of  thepreviously  reported  assays  is  not  great,  for  example,  anHPLC–UV method published by Farthing et al. had a lin-ear range for the detection of IOT in plasma from 10 to50 µg/mL [40].

s48,455,"Aspergillus  terreus strain  ZYL050009  was  isolated  fromsoil  samples  collected  from  the  yew  planting  base  atGuilin,  China.  The  isolate  was  identified  by  amplifica-tion of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer(ITS) region, using the primers ITS1 (5 ′ -TCC GTA GGTGAA  CCT  GCG  G-3 ′ )  and  ITS  4  (5 ′ -TCC  TCC  GCTTAT  TGA  TAT  GC-3 ′ )  (White  et  al.  1989).  The  ampli-cons  were  sequenced,  and  alignments  were  performedusing  BLASTN  algorithm.  Reference  sequences  withthe highest identity were selected and imported into the open source software MEGA 7.0 (Kumar et al. 2016). For the  phylogenetic  analysis,  tree  constructions  were  donewith the software MEGA 7.0 using the neighbor-joiningmethod  (Hall  2013).  Bootstrap  analysis  was  done  using1000-times resampled data."
