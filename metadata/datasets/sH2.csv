s23,1839,Magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl O ) was prepared bythe co-precipitation method [24]. Stoichiometric quantitiesof Mg (NO ) (cid:2) 6H O and Al (NO ) (cid:2) 9H O were dissolvedin distilled water and the precipitation of hydroxide wascarried out at a controlled pH 9 using 1 M NH OH solutionat room temperature with vigorous stirring. The precipitatewas washed several times with distilled water to removethe excess of nitrate ions. It was dried in an air oven at373 K for 12 h and then calcined at 1073 K for 8 h to givea spinel phase of MgAl O .
