Therefore, an addi-tional set of 4290 fragment-rich MS/MS spectra was created to enable distinguishing positional FAHFA isomers. Thelibrary was generated based on ion fragmentations and ion intensities of FAHFA external reference standards, devel-oping a heuristic model for fragmentation rules and extending these rules to large swaths of computer-generatedstructures of FAHFAs with varying chain lengths, degrees of unsaturation and hydroxyl group positions. Subsequently,we validated the new in silico library by discovering several new FAHFA species in egg yolk, showing that this libraryenables high-throughput screening of FAHFA lipids in various biological matrices."

s12,6,25,1,50,341,63,69,463,GfqjfpAdvTTb5929f4c,10,"Chlorogenic acids (CGAs) are a class of phytochemicals that are formed as esters between differentderivatives of cinnamic acid and quinic acid molecules. In plants, accumulation of these compounds has beenlinked to several physiological responses against various stress factors; however, biochemical synthesis differs fromone plant to another. Although structurally simple, the analysis of CGA molecules with modern analytical platformsposes an analytical challenge. The objective of the study was to perform a comparison of the CGA profiles andrelated derivatives from differentiated tobacco leaf tissues and undifferentiated cell suspension cultures."

Forall the 19 metabolites detected (Figure 1, Table 1), themass error was below 5 ppm. As previously mentioned,proper annotation of structurally similar isomers of cin-namic acid derivatives is a difficult task [9]. To avoid am-biguity during identification, using the IUPAC numberingsystem, we have considered all possible factors rangingfrom chromatographic separation to mass spectrometricbehaviour as shown in previously published data [10,12].In order to simplify identification, metabolites harboringcommon cinnamic acid moieties in their core structurewere monitored using a single mass extracted ion chro-matogram (XIC).

Similarly, the results of thecurrent study indicate that there exists a significantdifference in the CGA profiles of tobacco leaf tissueand cell suspensions. Possibly, the differences stemfrom different biochemical pathways leading to thebiosynthesis of CGA molecules in the two biologicalsystems. As already mentioned, the biochemical differ-ences between cells and leaf tissue could be a result ofthe different environmental conditions which the cellsand the leaves are exposed to as well as the level of tis-sue differentiation. This finding is in agreement withother published data where it was demonstrated that"

In a previous research, the sequential use of ultrasonication, liquid hot water, and ligninolytic enzymes wasselected as pretreatment for the production of ethanol from CGT. However, an increment in the ethanol productionis necessary. To accomplish that, this research evaluated the effect of pretreating CGT using alkaline ultrasonicationbefore a liquid hot water and ligninolytic enzymes pretreatments for ethanol production. Three NaOH concentrations(5%, 10%, and 15%) were employed for the alkaline ultrasonication. Additionally, this work is one of the first applicationsof Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum and principal component analysis (PCA) as fast methodology to identifythe differences in the biomass after different types of pretreatments."

s13,6,16,1,50,341,63,207,468,XvmfshAdvTTb5929f4c,10,"The three concentrations employed for the alkaline ultrasonication pretreatment produced ethanol yields andcellulose conversions higher than the experiment without NaOH. Furthermore, 15% NaOH concentration achievedtwofold increment yield versus the treatment without NaOH. The FT-IR spectrum confirmed modifications in theCGT structure in the different pretreatments. PCA was helpful to determine differences between the pretreatedand un-pretreated biomass and to evaluate how the CGT structure changed after each treatment."

To produce bioetha-nol from agro-industrial feedstocks, different kinds of pre-treatments have been investigated. These are generallydivided into physical, physicochemical, chemical, and bio-logical [5]. In CGT, the pretreatment principally used isphysicochemical (steam explosion) followed by chemical(acid or basic hydrolysis) and biological (fungal or enzym-atic) pretreatment [6,7].

Additionally,in sweet sorghum bagasse, the combination of alkaline hy-drolysis simultaneously with ultrasonication augmentedthe final ethanol yield and cellulose conversion [10]. Theuse of ultrasonication and alkali-hydrolysis has not beentested in CGT; thus, the synergic effect of these technolo-gies may raise delignification, cellulose conversion, andethanol yield from CGT. The effect of these pretreatmentsover the CGT structure can be determined using compos-itional analysis [11] and/or the biomass' Fourier transforminfrared (FT-IR) spectrum.

As a complemen-tary tool to FT-IR spectroscopy, multivariate statisticaltechniques have been employed to identify the modifica-tions in the FT-IR spectra and evaluate the difference be-tween the different treatments. One of these multivariatemethods is the principal component analysis (PCA); thistechnique reduces the dimensionality ofthe data byexplaining the variance-covariance structure of a set ofvariables using few linear combinations of these variables."

From these pre-treatments, the U-NaOH 15% + HW + E pretreatmentexhibited the highest cellulose conversion (41%) andethanol yield (64%). The use of FT-IR and principalcomponents was effective as a tool to identify the varia-tions in the signal of the cellulose, hemicellulose, andlignin from CGT after the different pretreatments. Add-itionally, the PCA could separate and identify the CGTbiomass from different types of pretreatments and iden-tify the signals with the most significant variation insidethe spectra.

Usually it has been found that C-prenylation of the flavonoid nucleus increases the cytotoxicactivity [9]. Moreover, as an additional benefit, prenylatedflavonoids are relatively non-toxic to non-cancer cells [9].In our case, O-prenylation was accompanied by a decreasein bioactivity, indicating the importance of free phenolicgroups. This conclusion is further supported by the obser-vation that, after prenylation, acetylation of the remainingfree phenolic groups further reduced the cytotoxicity."

s16,6,14,1,50,289,63,96,468,YcqrvvAdvTTb5929f4c,10,"Enzymatic cascades in metabolic pathways are spatially organized in such a way as to facilitate the flow ofsubstrates. The construction of artificial cellulase complexes that mimic natural multienzyme assemblies can potentiallyenhance the capacity for cellulose hydrolysis. In this study, an artificial cellulase complex was constructed by tetheringthree cellulases to a synthetic protein scaffold."
s16,6,15,1,50,289,63,96,468,XxlvkwAdvTT99c4c969,10,Results:
s16,6,16,1,50,289,63,96,468,YcqrvvAdvTTb5929f4c,10,Three pairs of interacting proteins were selected and characterized. The artificial protein scaffolds wereconstructed by fusing three interacting proteins. Cellulases were tethered to these synthetic scaffolds in differentorders. The optimal assembly resulted in a 1.5-fold higher hydrolysis of cellulose than that achieved by unassembledcellulases.

s16,7,18,1,50,391,63,33,454,YcqrvvAdvTTb5929f4c,10,A novel artificial protein scaffold was constructed and used to assemble three cellulases. The resultantincrease in enzymatic activity suggests that this can be used as a strategy for enhancing the biocatalytic capacity ofenzyme cascades.

These resultssuggest that this novel protein scaffold can serve as apowerful tool for facilitating multienzyme cascades."

Phytochemicals  in  plants  are  responsible  for  theirbiological  activities  [4].  Typically,  such  compounds  areproduced  and  accumulate  at  various  levels  in  plant  tis-sues. Their production strongly correlates to the growingclimate,  agricultural  practices,  specific  vegetative  stages,and  other  environmental  variables  [15–17].  Results  ofprevious studies have shown that the production of phy-tochemicals and the biological activity of the same vari-ety/species of plant can be different when sampling wasdone  from  different  areas  [17].  Therefore,  to  produceplants  with  higher  phytochemical  quality  and  biologi-cal  activity  it  is  necessary  to  optimize  the  plantation  orsampling  process.

The blank(150 µL broth) and the bacteria (100 µL broth and 50 µLbacteria  suspension)  were  prepared  and  gentamicin  andciprofloxacin  were  used  as  positive  controls.  The  plateswere  incubated  for  24  h  at  37  °C.  The  diameter  of  theclear area (in mm) was measured directly on the dishes.The MIC was determined by selecting the lowest concen-tration (highest dilution) of seed extract that showed nogrowth of the bacteria strains after 24 h. Three replicateswere used for each concentration of the extract (Table 1).

s18,5,18,1,50,247,63,109,463,MyriadPro-Light,10,"This commentary highlights the recent work published in journal Nature on the structural based discovery of novelanalgesic compounds for opioid receptors with minimal effects. Manglik et al. selectively targeted the Gi based μORpathway instead of the β‑arrestin pathway of the opioids. The computational screening of millions of compoundsshowed a list of several competent ligands. From these ligands they synthesized the compounds with the bestdocking score, which were further optimized by adding side residues for better interaction with the μOR. A promis‑ing compound, PZM21, was a selective agonist of μOR. It has better analgesic properties with minimal side effects ofrespiratory depression and constipation. This work is a step towards better drug designing and synthesizing in termsof efficacy, specificity with least side effects of targeted GPCR proteins present in the human proteome."

The  opi-oid receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs),whose  signaling  is  mediated  through  the  G  proteins  [1].In the last few years, there has been a surge in high reso-lution  X-ray  crystallographic  structures  of  GPCRs;  par-ticularly  from  the  Kobilka  research  group  at  StanfordUniversity.

The  GPCR  proteins  are  importantdrug targets and it is estimated that around 30% or moreof the available marketed drugs are for GPCR related dis-eases  [9].  There  is  a  general  consensus  that  around  350GPCRs are involved in various human diseases. Another~ 100 GPCRs (called orphan GPCRs) have little informa-tion available about their natural ligands or physiologicalfunction  [10].

s19,17,46,1,50,357,306,246,238,TvjqksAdvPTimes,9,"Nanotechnology is one of the most fascinating researchareas in modern material science. In general, particles witha size less than 100 nm are referred to as nanoparticles.Entirely novel and enhanced characteristics such as size,distribution and morphology have been revealed by theseparticles in comparison to the larger particles of bulkmaterial [1]. Nanoparticles are gaining importance in theﬁelds of biology, medicine and electronics owing to theirunique physical and biological properties [2]. Among themetallic nanoparticles, Silver has been enormously utilizedfor its diverse applications in the ﬁelds of bio-labeling, optbiosensors, polarizing ﬁlters, electrical batteries, cancercell imaging, drug delivery systems etc. [3]. Silver has longtowardbeen recognized as having an inhibitory effectmany microorganisms [4] while it is not toxic to humancells in low concentrations [5]. The most widely used andknown applications of silver and silver nanoparticles are inthe medical industry; for example, in topical ointments toprevent infection of burns or open wounds and also in"

s19,18,48,1,50,606,306,159,238,TvjqksAdvPTimes,9,"Many techniques of synthesizing silver nanoparticles(SNPs) have been reported in the literature; and chemicalreduction is the most commonly used method for thepreparation of SNPs [7]. Reducing agents commonly usedin chemical reduction are borohydride, citrate, ascorbate,and elemental hydrogen [8]. Most of these methods areextremely expensive and also involve the use of toxic andhazardous chemicals, which may pose potential environ-"

It is expectedthat plants with higher reducing capacity are more potent inreducing metallic ions to metallic nanoparticles [14].Phenolic compounds are the major constituents of antiox-idants of most plant species and their antioxidant activity ismainly due to their redox properties. As a result, they canact as reducing agents in neutralizing free radicals [15, 16]and the reduction of metallic ions to metallic nanoparticles[17]."

We investigate whether these experts, drawn largely from the pharmaceutical industry andacademia, can match or exceed the predictive power of algorithms. Alongside this, we implement 10 typical machinelearning algorithms on the same dataset. The best algorithm, a variety of neural network known as a multi-layerperceptron, gave an RMSE of 0.985 log S units and an  R"

The collection of algorithms containeda higher proportion of reasonably good predictors, nine out of ten compared with around half of the humans. Wefound that, for either humans or algorithms, combining individual predictions into a consensus predictor by takingtheir median generated excellent predictivity. While our consensus human predictor achieved very slightly betterheadline figures on various statistical measures, the difference between it and the consensus machine learning pre-dictor was both small and statistically insignificant. We conclude that human experts can predict the aqueous solubil-ity of druglike molecules essentially equally well as machine learning algorithms. We find that, for either humans oralgorithms, combining individual predictions into a consensus predictor by taking their median is a powerful way ofbenefitting from the wisdom of crowds."

Thermo-dynamic solubility is the solubility measured under equi-librium  conditions.  It  can  be  determined  with  a  shakeflask  approach,  or  by  using  a  method  like  CheqSol  [6],where  equilibration  is  speeded  up  by  shuttling  betweensuper-  and  subsaturated  solutions  via  additions  of  smalltitres of acid or alkali. The Solubility Challenge [7, 8] usedits  own  bespoke  dataset,  measuring  intrinsic  aqueousthermodynamic  solubility  with  the  CheqSol  method.  Itsauthors  reported  high  reproducibility  and  claimed  ran-dom  errors  of  only  0.05  log  S  units.  Despite  this,  studyof  the  literature  suggests  that  overall  errors  in  reportedintrinsic  solubilities  of  drug-like  molecules  are  around0.6–0.7  log  S  units,  as  discussed  by  Palmer  &  Mitchelland previously by Jorgensen & Duffy [9, 10]."

They  reported  alarge  improvement  in  accuracy,  with  the  ensemble  pre-diction being better than even the best performing singleneural network. The use of multiple independent modelsis also fundamental to other ensemble predictors, such asRandom Forest, and to consensus methods for rescoringdocked protein–ligand complexes [23]. Utilising the wis-dom of crowds requires an algorithm or experiment thatcan produce many independent predictors, though basedon essentially the same pool of input data."

Orphan  drugs  are  potential  pharmaceuticalsthat  remain  commercially  undeveloped,  often  becausethey treat diseases too rare for commercially viable drugdevelopment by pharmaceutical companies in a competi-tive  market.  Regulators  incentivise  the  development  ofthese  drugs  by  allowing  market  exclusivity;  a  new  drugfor  these  conditions  is  only  approved  if  is  judged  to  besufficiently  dissimilar  to  products  already  on  the  mar-ket.  Judging  whether  or  not  two  compounds  are  similaris time consuming for the team of experts. Thus, Francoet al. [24] asked whether computers could reproduce therulings  of  experts.  Human  specialists  were  shown  100pairs  of  molecules  and  asked  to  quantify  their  similar-ity.  Their  results  were  statistically  compared  to  similari-ties computed with 2D fingerprint methods.

It appears that the data dif-ferences  between  the  survey  training  set  and  the  DLS-100 set had very little effect on the quality of the machinelearning  predictions  and  therefore  are  unlikely  to  havehad a substantial effect on the human predictions.

As  a  general  trend,  compounds  with  solubili-ties  around  the  middle  of  the  range  are  well-predicted.The  two  most  soluble  molecules,  pteridine  and  anti-pyrine,  are  the  two  worst  predicted  according  to  bothmeasures.  For  the  least  soluble  compounds,  the  pictureis  mixed.  The  second  and  fourth  most  insoluble  com-pounds,  mifepristone  and  trihexyphenidyl,  are  poorlyhandled,  being  the  third  and  fourth  worst  predicted  oneither measure. However, the most insoluble compound,triphenylene, is well predicted and the third most insolu-ble,  estrone,  moderately  well  predicted  with  14  correctpredictions."

s21,814,1036,11,8458,8729,56,201,236,WarnockPro-Regular,9,"Both these results lead to the conclusion that machinelearning algorithms and human experts predict aqueoussolubility  essentially  equally  well.  The  machine  learn-ers  had  access  to  over  a  hundred  descriptors  for  eachcompound,  essentially  infallible  memory,  and  the  abil-ity to implement intricately designed algorithmic proce-dures with fast and precise numerical calculations. Thusit  is  perhaps  surprising  that  they  were  unable  to  out-perform  humans  at  this  task.  Our  experiences  with  thisstudy,  however,  suggest  that  the  prediction  of  solubilityfor more than around 25 molecules in one sitting wouldbecome  an  onerous  task  for  most  humans,  whereas  acomputer  is  unlikely  to  complain  if  asked  to  make  pre-dictions  for  a  thousand  compounds.  Thus,  our  experi-mental  design  was  somewhat  contrived  to  minimise  themachines’ inherent advantage of an essentially unlimitedattention span."

Given  the  estimated  uncertainty  inavailable  experimental  data,  the  best  possible  predictorson  existing  data  might  achieve  RMSEs  around  0.6–0.7,though this figure is subject to debate, while a minimallyuseful predictor would be around 1.8 log S units for ourdataset.  Thus  the  current  state  of  prediction,  for  bothhumans and machines, is somewhat better than the mid-dle of the range between minimally useful and best realis-tically possible predictors."

Production of styrene is one of such processes. Itis a major petrochemical commodity used for the produc-tion of many different polymeric materials, such as acry-styrene–acrylonitrilelonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS),(SAN), styrene–butadiene rubberItsnumber of applications and demand are still growing. It iscommercially produced by vapor-phase dehydrogenationof ethylbenzene (DHEB) with large excess of superheatedsteam over potassium promoted iron oxide (Fe–K–O) cat-alyst in the temperature range of 873–973 K [2]. The maindrawback of this process is its strongly endothermic char-acter and limited equilibrium conversion of ethylbenzene[3].

However, separation of products andrecycling of reactants in direct coupling reaction mayrequire additional unit operations. In practice, operation ofcoupled reaction in the same reactor to give two usefulproducts over a single catalyst outweighs the cost requiredfor additional units [12, 13]. Therefore, coupling of DHEBto styrene with hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to anilineappears to be an interesting synergetic pair as shown in thescheme.

The increase in the conversion of ethyl-benzene with rise in temperature can be attributed to shiftin the equilibrium to the right favoring the forward reac-tion. The selectivity of styrene decreases with increase intemperature due to formation of higher amount of crackingand hydrogenolysis products such as benzene and toluene.It is interesting to observe that the selectivity of anilinemaintained maximum at all the reaction temperatures.

Electron delocalization indices, instead, measurethe number of electron pairs shared by two atomic basins[32] and can also be used to reveal the degree of covalencein intermolecular bonding. In addition, they may antici-pate exchange paths in magnetic frameworks, especiallyin metal based materials. The nature of metal-ligandbonds is extremely important in one sector of crystalengineering, namely that of coordination polymers, andwill be discussed in section 3. Other interactions betweenmolecules are more genuinely classified into the closed-shell class, although some amount of covalence might bepresent, sometime playing a fundamental role."

A newXCW approach was recently proposed by Genoni [99],who implemented the method for extremely localized mo-lecular orbital wave functions. An alternative way to esti-mate the crystal properties is however that of calculatingwith high accuracy the molecular quantities, then applyingcorrections for the perturbation of the crystal packing.For example, quite effective is the distributed atomicpolarizability approach to estimate linear optical proper-ties implemented in PolaBer [89]. The atomic polarizabil-ities can be used to calculate the electric susceptibility,through the anisotropic Lorentz approximation.

s27,5,19,1,50,325,63,193,468,MyriadPro-Light,10,"Natural products represent a prominent source of pharmaceutically and industrially important agents. Calculatingthe chemical similarity of two molecules is a central task in cheminformatics, with applications at multiple stages ofthe drug discovery pipeline. Quantifying the similarity of natural products is a particularly important problem, as thebiological activities of these molecules have been extensively optimized by natural selection. The large and structur-ally complex scaffolds of natural products distinguish their physical and chemical properties from those of syntheticcompounds. However, no analysis of the performance of existing methods for molecular similarity calculation specificto natural products has been reported to date. Here, we present LEMONS, an algorithm for the enumeration of hypo-thetical modular natural product structures. We leverage this algorithm to conduct a comparative analysis of molecu-lar similarity methods within the unique chemical space occupied by modular natural products using controlledsynthetic data, and comprehensively investigate the impact of diverse biosynthetic parameters on similarity search.We additionally investigate a recently described algorithm for natural product retrobiosynthesis and alignment, andfind that when rule-based retrobiosynthesis can be applied, this approach outperforms conventional two-dimen-sional fingerprints, suggesting it may represent a valuable approach for the targeted exploration of natural productchemical space and microbial genome mining. Our open-source algorithm is an extensible method of enumeratinghypothetical natural product structures with diverse potential applications in bioinformatics."

As the performance of some methods isclaimed to exhibit a ligand size dependency, we next eval-uate the relationship between natural product size (num-ber of monomers) and similarity search. To more closelyapproximate the enzymatic tailoring reactions that occurin biosynthetic pathways, we then quantify the impact ofmacrocyclization and glycosylation. Finally, we use LEM-ONS to generate realistic libraries of extensively tailorednatural products, such as those shown in Fig. 2, and pro-vide  general  guidance  for  chemical  similarity  search  inmodular natural product chemical space."

Averaged  across  all  fingerprints,  a  starter  unitsubstitution was equivalent to 1.70 non-starter-unit sub-stitutions (Additional file 3: Fig. S2). These results suggestthat, in general, similarity search is strongly influenced bythe unique structural properties of modular natural prod-uct  starter  units.  While  this  phenomenon  may  facilitatethe clustering of natural products of the same family thatshare a common starter unit, it may represent an obstacleto  the  cheminformatic  identification  of  natural  productfamilies with variable starter units."

Differ-ent  chemical  similarity  search  strategies  may  thereforeexhibit optimal performance on compound families withlower  or  higher  average  molecular  weights.  We  investi-gated  the  effect  of  size  on  chemical  similarity  algorithmperformance by generating libraries of hypothetical natu-ral products of fixed sizes. Libraries of hypothetical non-ribosomal  peptides,  polyketides,  hybrids,  and  hybridswith  starter  units  consisting  of  4  to  15  monomers  weregenerated, and the performance of each algorithm with 3monomer substitutions was evaluated (Fig. 5).

In  order  to  evaluate  theimpact of macrocyclization on natural product similaritysearch,  we  generated  cyclic  and  branched  hypotheticalnonribosomal peptides, polyketides, and hybrids (Fig. 6).Averaged across all fingerprints, substitution of the cycli-zation  pattern  was  equivalent  to  substitution  of  0.75monomers  in  a  hybrid  natural  product.  Notably,  ECFPfingerprints with a radius between 2 and 6 were at least10%  less  accurate  when  the  pattern  of  macrocyclizationwas changed relative to the substitution of a single mono-mer. These results indicate that macrocyclization makes arelatively small contribution to natural product similaritysearch, except in methods that heavily weight local atom"

We  use  this  algo-rithm  to  benchmark  chemical  similarity  methods  formodular  natural  products,  finding  that  circular  finger-prints and a newly described retrobiosynthetic approach(GRAPE/GARLIC)  perform  best,  whereas  topologicalfingerprints  and  most  substructure-based  fingerprintsperform less well (with the notable exception of the Kle-kota–Roth  fingerprint).  Additionally,  we  investigate  theimpact  of  biosynthetic  parameters  on  similarity  search,finding  that  size  and  macrocyclization  have  relativelylittle  impact  on  similarity  search,  whereas  inclusion  ofnonproteinogenic  amino  acids  and  starter  units  have  a"

LEMONS first enumerates alibrary of hypothetical natural product structures given alist  of  possible  monomers  and  tailoring  reactions.  Eachhypothetical natural product structure may subsequentlybe  modified  by  substituting  one  or  more  monomers,  orby adding, removing, or changing the site of one or moretailoring  reactions.  The  modified  structure  is  compared"

The  first,  sub-structure  keys-based  fingerprints,  set  the  bits  within  amolecular fingerprint bit sequence based on the presenceor absence of predefined structural features. The MACCS(Molecular  ACCess  System)  fingerprint  is  among  thebest-known  substructure  keys-based  fingerprints  [47].The PubChem database implements another substructurekeys-based fingerprint for similarity search, based on 881structural  keys  [48].  Both  the  79  electrotopological  state(E-state) fragments defined by Hall and Kier [49] and the4860 unique chemical substructures which enrich for bio-logical activity defined by Klekota and Roth [50] have alsobeen  used  within  substructure  keys-based  fingerprintsimplemented in the Chemistry Development Kit [45]."

s28,6,20,1,50,315,63,82,465,FbhpnjAdvTTb5929f4c,10,"pharmaceutical applications, as versatile drug delivery agent. Chitosan has been already shown to serve as vehiclefor sustained drug release by chitosan-vanadium(IV) complex from a chitosan gel matrix. Therefore, chitosan gelproved to retain vanadium and preserve its insulin-mimetic efficacy. Nevertheless, there is a lack of reportsconcerning complexing equilibria in aqueous solution, in particular when using the more advantageousmicrocrystalline form of chitosan (MCCh).

The  inability  of  mesophilicmicroorganisms  to  survive  in  psychrophilic  temperaturerange results in 70 % reduced production of biogas duringwinters in hilly areas (Kanwar and Guleri 1994).

Now  focus  is  shiftingtowards natural biomass as a potential source for carbonprecursors. Several natural biomasses have been exploredfor  production  of  activated  carbon  (Demiral  and  Demi-ral  2008;  Hu  et  al.  2010;  Li  et  al.  2010,  2011;  Wei  et  al.2011; Xu et al. 2012; Biswal et al. 2013; Falco et al. 2013;Huang  et  al.  2013;  Wang  et  al.  2013;  Bhattacharjya  andSung  2014).  Activated  carbon  has  recently  been  synthe-sised  from  cow  dung  by  a  modified  chemical  activationmethod,  in  which  partially  carbonised  cow  dung  wastreated with potassium hydroxide in the ratio of 2:1. Thesynthesised activated carbon when tested as supercapaci-tor electrodes in practical showed specific capacitance of124 F/g at 0.1 A/g and retained up to 117 F/g at 1.0 A/gcurrent  density.  It  is  also  durable  for  long-term  opera-tions (Yang et al. 2012). The synthesis of activated carbonhaving high surface area along with optimum microporeand  mesopore  volume  reflects  excellent  electrochemicalapplication  of  cow  dung  for  supercapacitors.  The  litera-ture also suggest that biological waste like cow dung canbe  converted  into  a  electrode  material  for  other  energystorage  and  conversion  systems  such  as  Li-ion  batteriesand fuel cells."

Extensive  useof  chemical  fertilisers  is  suggested  for  replenishmentof  nutritional  deficiencies  to  increase  crop  yield.  Manydisadvantages  of  widespread  use  of  chemical  fertilisersinclude  increase  in  soil  acidity,  mineral  imbalance  andsoil  degradation  (Kang  and  Juo  1980;  Ayoola  and  Mak-inde  2008)  and  even  farmers  nowadays  do  not  preferchemical  fertilisers  (Bedada  et  al.  2014).

One way to coun-ter this soil fertility problem is ISFM, i.e., Integrated SoilFertility  Management,  a  technique  that  makes  use  ofboth organic and inorganic resources resulting in greateryield response and better nutrient storage (Bedada et al.2014; Ewusi-Mensah et al. 2015). For example, combina-tion of cow dung with NPK (15:15:15) in the concentra-tion of 3 t/ha and 100 kg/ha, respectively, showed markedincrease  of  8.9  t/ha  in  the  yield  of  potato  tuber  in  com-parison to control that yielded only 1.8 t/ha.

Thesemetals  destroy  the  growth  and  metabolism  of  cells,  dis-rupt  the  respiratory  tract  and  accumulate  in  internalorgans such as lever, heart and kidneys. Industrial wasteis  one  of  the  major  sources  of  heavy  metal  contamina-tion of environment and involved in destruction of floraand fauna of water (Feng et al. 2004; Lakshmi et al. 2008;Kiaune  and  Singhasemanon  2011;  Madu  et  al.  2011;Soni and Gupta 2011; Ali et al. 2013; Thajeel et al. 2013;Mohan  and  Gupta  2014).  Remediation  of  heavy  metalsis  commonly  done  by  electrolytic  deposition,  electrodi-alysis,  electrochemical,  evaporation,  precipitation,  ionexchange,  reduction,  reverse  osmosis,  filtration,  adsorp-tion,  chemical  precipitation  and  distillation  (Mohapa-tra et al. 2007, 2008; Mohan and Gupta 2014). All thesemethods  are  expensive  and  not  environment  friendly;hence,  there  is  a  need  of  cleaner  and  greener  methods.Cow  dung  and  its  microorganisms  have  recently  beentapped  for  the  remediation  of  heavy  metals  like  chro-mium,  strontium  and  arsenic.  Arsenic  can  be  detoxifiedby  methylation  process.  The  ability  of  bacteria  to  meth-ylate  arsenic  into  volatile  products  mainly  arsine,  in  theform  of  dimethylarsine,  is  already  known  (Bachofenet al. 1995). Mohapatra et al. (2008) have shown that cowdung  can  act  as  a  major  substrate  for  bacterial  growthduring  removal  of  arsenic  from  arsenic-rich  sludge  bymeans  of  volatilisation.  It  was  detected  that  methano-genic  bacteria  at  substrate,  i.e.,  cow  dung  concentrationof 25 mg/l, could effectively volatilise around 35 % arse-nic.  Dry  cow  dung  powder  has  recently  been  used  as  asource of adsorption for the removal of chromium fromaqueous  solution  and  achieved  73.8  %  removal  of  chro-mium  (Mohan  and  Gupta  2014).  Another  heavy  metal,i.e.,  radiotoxic  strontium  which  is  very  hazardous  dueto half-life of 29 years, imitates calcium in the body andincreases  the  risk  of  bone  cancer  and  leukaemia  (Peter-son  et  al.  2007;  Barot  and  Bagla  2012).  Barot  and  Bagla(2012)  detected  biosorption  of  a  radiotoxic  strontium(90Sr) by dry cow dung powder. 350 mg of dry cow dungpowder  along  with  certain  laboratory  conditions  suchas  pH  6,  contact  time  of  10  min  and  agitation  speed  of4000  rpm  resulted  in  85–90  %  adsorption  of  strontium.Thus, dry cow dung powder may be preferred over othersynthetic  adsorbents  because  of  their  production  cost,time and energy requirements. Cow dung is a cheap andeconomically  viable  resource  which  is  easily  available.According to the above-discussed data, cow dung can beemployed  with  or  without  pre-  or  post-treatment  as  anexcellent measure to bioremediate nonbiodegradable and"

Immunostimulatory,immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory effects of pan-chagavya  are  also  being  mentioned  in  Ayurveda  (Chau-han 2005; Dhama et al. 2005a; Donovan 2008; Jain et al.2010;  Sathasivam  et  al.  2010;  Girija  et  al.  2013;  Dhamaet  al.  2013).

s29,54,320,7,5095,5531,56,288,236,GcfwwvWarnockPro-Regular,9,"Cow  dung  host  a  wide  variety  of  microorganisms  vary-ing  in  individual  properties.  Exploitation  of  cow  dungmicroflora  can  contribute  significantly  in  sustainableagriculture  and  energy  requirements.  It  is  one  of  thebioresources  of  this  world  which  is  available  on  largescale  and  still  not  fully  utilised.  The  understanding  ofthe mechanisms enabling cow dung microbes to degradehydrocarbons  can  promote  bioremediation  of  environ-mental  pollutants.  With  recent  advances  in  scientificresearch and techniques for complete genome sequences,the  genes  responsible  for  bioremediation  can  be  identi-fied.  Another  exciting  area  of  research  for  future  stud-ies  is  developing  microbial  enzymes  and  antimicrobials.The production of enzymes by microorganisms from thischeap  bioresource  can  find  wide  applications  in  variousfields  such  as  agriculture,  chemistry  and  biotechnology.The  application  of  cow  dung  microflora  with  consider-able  antimicrobial  potential  can  result  in  the  promotionof  human  health;  however,  comprehensive  screening  ofthese microorganisms for the production of antibacterial,antifungal and antiviral metabolites needed to be investi-gated. It is certainly evident that more detailed studies ofcow dung are needed, as there is still a tremendous scope"
s29,55,321,7,5095,5186,304,57,236,GcfwwvWarnockPro-Regular,9,"for  research  and  development  to  reach  up  to  the  indus-trial scale production of antibiotics and enzymes. In thisway,  cow  dung  may  be  considered  as  an  easily  availablebioresource  that  holds  a  great  potential  for  sustainabledevelopment in the near future."

s30,9,19,1,50,332,51,246,238,CvmxnrAdvPTimes,9,"Lubricating oil can be easily polluted by waterand emulsiﬁed, thereby negatively affecting the lubricatingproperty. Meanwhile, wasted lubricating oil, a complexcomposition, presents high water content and exists withemulsion. A single technological method is difﬁcult to besatisﬁed for efﬁcient demulsiﬁcation and dehydration ofemulsiﬁed lubricating oil. In this paper, it is proposed thatthe swirl centrifugal ﬁeld made by hydrocyclone, pulseelectric ﬁeld, and vacuum temperature ﬁeld are coupled toachieve the oil’s dehydration. Based on the theories, it isreasonable to use three ﬁelds for oil’s demulsiﬁcation. Inthe experiment of three-ﬁeld dehydrating, the demulsiﬁ-cation device is divided into two parts, namely, the coupledunit of pulse electric ﬁeld and hydrocyclone, and the vac-uum heating unit. The structure and size of the device wereoptimized through numerical simulation. With two modesof single ﬁeld and three-ﬁeld, the experiments were carriedout. Results indicated that the use of three-ﬁeld was moreenergy efﬁcient and faster compared with the traditionalvacuum heating method only."

s30,20,40,1,50,357,306,196,238,CvmxnrAdvPTimes,9,"Lubricating oil, the second largest petroleum product, iswidely used in machinery, electric power, transportation,and chemicalis prone toindustry [1]. Lubricating oilpollution during storage, transportation, ﬁlling and usage,and is then converted into emulsiﬁed oil [2]. The emulsi-ﬁed oil affects the physical and chemical properties of thelubricating oil, thereby leading to a decreased level ofoiliness and lubrication failure [3]. The dehydration andpuriﬁcation treatment of emulsiﬁed lubricating oilisimportant in prolonging the service life, recovering theusability of the oil, reducing the generation of waste oil andensuring the safe operation of the equipment [4]. In addi-tion, the annual quantity of waste lubricating oil is high, ofwhich 40–45 % can be reused through regeneration treat-ment [5]. The dehydration treatment is the ﬁrst step in theregeneration technology of waste lubricating oil [6]."

s30,21,42,1,50,556,306,209,238,CvmxnrAdvPTimes,9,"as follows: (1) sedimentation, low demulsiﬁcation efﬁ-ciency; (2) centrifugation, easily causes too much loss ofoil additives; (3) vacuum heating, high energy consump-tion; (4) ﬁltration,limited processing ability; and (5)chemical methods, the oil can be easily polluted by thechemical demulsiﬁer [7]. Over the recent years, severalnew demulsiﬁcation methods have been developed, such aspulse electric ﬁeld method [8], ultrasonic method [9],microwave method [10], and biological methods [11]. For"

As the oil moves toward thehydrocyclone’s central axis, a centronucleus is formed,ﬂows to the entrance direction, and is expelled from theoverﬂow port [19]. Oil–water is separated through thisprocess. In hydrocyclone, the oil droplets are subjected toviscous shear stress, Reynolds shear stress, and Magnusforce [20]. Numerical simulation is used to study oil/waterseparation properties because the ﬂow ﬁeld is compara-tively complex [21].

The dehydration process mainly consists of twoparts, namely,the hydrocyclone with a set of copperelectrodes ﬁxed on the parallel part of the entrance andthe back-end vacuum heating dehydration portion. Underthe effect of screw pump, solid impurities (such as metalparticles and sand) in oil can be ﬁltered through thestrainer. The emulsion droplets from the strainer coalesceand increase in size because the pulse electric ﬁeld isfused in the hydrocyclone, and the oil–water separationis rapidly accomplished under the effect of the swirlfrom the overﬂow port ofcentrifugal ﬁeld. The oilhydrocyclone contains a small amount of water, which isto be removed using the pulse electric anddifﬁculthydrocyclone ﬁelds only. After being heated,the oil"

s30,211,487,7,5095,5179,51,246,238,CvmxnrAdvPTimes,9,"High-voltage pulse electric ﬁeld, which has a simplestructure, can be used to rapidly polarize and coalesceemulsion droplets in oil. Instead of the use of gravity ﬁeldfor the droplet settling, the hydrocyclone ﬁeld can be usedto rapidly and efﬁciently separate oil and big emulsiondroplets, thereby considerably shortening the dehydrationtime. The vacuum heating ﬁeld can dehydrate tiny emul-sion droplets in oil. At present, vacuum heating is the onlyphysical method that can be used to achieve a high dehy-dration degree of the emulsiﬁed oil. When the high-voltagepulse electric ﬁeld, swirl centrifugal ﬁeld by hydrocyclone,and vacuum heating ﬁeld are integrated, the original singletreatment process can be modiﬁed and a new demulsiﬁ-cation and dehydration technology of emulsiﬁed lubricat-ing oil is achieved. The electric ﬁeld–hydrocyclone ﬁeld"

s31,5,20,1,50,325,63,73,470,MyriadPro-Light,10,") was exploredfor its possible use as an organic fertilizer. Replicated plant growth trials were conducted using four levels of parthe-nium vermicompost (0, 2.5, 3.75, and 5 t/ha) to assess their effects on the germination, growth, and fruition of a typi-cal food plant ladies finger ("
s31,5,21,1,50,325,63,73,470,MyriadPro-LightIt,10,Abelmoschus esculentus
s31,5,22,1,50,325,63,73,470,MyriadPro-Light,10,). Additionally the role of vermicompost in reducing plant pestsand disease was evaluated.
s31,6,23,1,50,403,63,46,464,MyriadPro-Semibold,10,Results:
s31,6,24,1,50,403,63,46,464,MyriadPro-Light,10,"Vermicompost encouraged the germination and growth of ladies finger at all levels of vermicompost appli-cation, with best results obtained in 5 t/ha treatments. The positive impact extended up to the fruit yield. Vermicom-post application also improved the quality of fruits in terms of mineral, protein, and carbohydrate contents, andreduced the disease incidence and pest attacks."
s31,7,25,1,50,454,63,46,469,MyriadPro-Semibold,10,Conclusions:
s31,7,26,1,50,454,63,46,469,MyriadPro-Light,10,The studies establish the fact that parthenium acquires all the qualities of a good organic fertilizer withconcomitant loss of its toxic and allelopathic properties after it gets vermicomposted. The findings raise the prospectsof economical and eco-friendly utilization of billions of tons of parthenium biomass which is generated annually butgoes to waste at present.

It  is  an  annual  flowering,  erect,and  severally  branched  ubiquitous  herb,  which  growsaggressively  in  a  wide  range  of  habitats  (Akter  and  Zuberi2009). Due to the absence of any effective natural enemiesand due to its allelopathic nature, large seed bank, and fastgrowth  rate,  parthenium  grows  luxuriantly  all  through  theyear, infesting millions of hectares of land masses includingagricultural fields, parks, orchards, railway tracks, and otheropen areas (Wiesner et al. 2007; Nigatu et al. 2010; Qureshi"

Exposure to parthenium also causes systemic toxic-ity including loss of skin pigmentation, dermatitis, diarrhea,and degenerative changes in liver and kidneys in livestockwho  accidentally  graze  upon  parthenium  (Gunaseelan1987; Rajkumar et al. 1988; Lakshmi and Srinivas 2007)."
s31,17,45,2,890,1078,56,249,237,WarnockPro-Regular,9,"The eradication of parthenium is a major challenge, pri-marily  because  of  its  epidemic  proliferation,  strong  repro-ductive  potential,  hardiness,  and  competitiveness,  apartfrom its wide ecological adoptability. Efforts made across theworld to find persistent methods of controlling partheniumby way of mechanical, chemical, or biological means, haveat best achieved only partial and temporary success (Manoj"
s31,17,46,2,890,1078,56,249,237,WarnockPro-Regular,9,"2014; Hussain et al. 2016a). The weed has never been eradi-cated from any country and its spread in all the tropical andsub-tropical  regions  of  the  world  is  only  increasing  withtime.  When  viewed  as  a  resource,  for  the  generation  ofgreen manure, biogas production, biopesticides, and drugs(Abbasi  et  al.  1990;  Kishor  et  al.  2010;  Kumar  et  al.  2012;Gunaseelan 1987; Patel 2011; Tauseef et al. 2013; Singh andGarg  2014;  Kumar  et  al. 2014;  Anwar  et  al. 2015;  Hussainet al. 2016b), parthenium has proved uneconomical, expen-sive, and unsustainable. Thus finding an ecologically soundand economically viable means by which parthenium can begainfully utilized in large quantities appears to be the onlyrecourse  which  can  make  it  profitable  to  regularly  harvestthe weed, thereby keeping it under some control."
s31,18,47,2,890,1330,56,285,236,WarnockPro-Regular,9,"One  such  option  is  conversion  of  parthenium  biomassinto  organic  fertilizer  through  vermicomposting.  Whena  substrate  is  vermicomposted,  it  converts  the  latter  intofine peat-like material and transforms some of its nutrientsinto more bioavailable forms (Hussain et al. 2015, 2016a, b.The vermicompost acquires several species of microflora,besides  hormones  and  enzymes  as  it  passes  though  theearthworms’ gut (Pramanik et al. 2007; Ievinsh 2011). Paststudies  have  reported  that  vermicompost  derived  fromanimal manure stimulated seed germination (Atiyeh et al.2000;  Zaller  2007;  Lazcano  et  al.  2010),  enhanced  plantgrowth (Edwards Clive 2004; Lazcano et al. 2009; Samrotet al. 2015), and the yield and the quality of fruits (Singhet al. 2008; Doan et al. 2015) of several plant species. Theyare  also  believed  to  induce  resistance  in  plants  againstpests and disease (Yardim et al. 2006; Edwards et al. 2010;Serfoji et al. 2010; Carr and Nelson 2014).

Butwill the beneficial effect extend to plant growth, fruit yield,and  quality  of  the  fruit?  Will  the  parthenium  vermicom-post also help the fertilized plants to repel pathogens theway manure-derived vermicomposts are known to do?

The increase in seed germina-tion  in  vermicompost-amended  soils  may  be  due  to  theincreased  concentrations  of  nitrate  and  ammonium  inthem,  relative  to  the  control  soils.  It  is  now  beyond  thedispute  that  nitrate  and  ammonium  are  efficient  break-ers  of  seed  dormancy,  facilitating  germination  (Bewleyand  Black  1982;  Hilhorst  and  Karssen  2000).

In the present study we suggest that parthe-nium vermicompost may have also imbibed with similarattributes  to  that  of  the  manure-based  vermicompoststhat  has  resulted  in  greater  germination  success,  betterplant  growth,  and  yield  of  ladies  finger  plants.  Recently(Hussain et al. 2016a, b) have reported that partheniumvermicompost  contains  a  number  of  fatty  acids,  alco-hols, alkanes, alkenes, and nitrogenous compounds in itand enhanced the microbial biomass carbon of the soil.Beside  these  factors,  parthenium  vermicompost,  as  likemanure-based  vermicomposts,  is  also  known  to  inducepositive  impact  on  soil  physical  properties  and  hencemay  also  have  contributed  to  the  better  plant  growth(Hussain et al. 2016a)."

Thetotal  solids  and  ash  (mineral)  content  of  vermicompost-treated  plants  were  also  significantly  higher  compared  tothe controls. An increase in the protein and carbohydrateconcentrations were also recorded in the plants grown invermicompost-amended  soils  (Fig.  2).  All  these  gains  areperhaps  due  to  the  greater  bioavailability  of  nutrients  invermicompost  treatments  compared  to  the  controls,  ashas  been  earlier  seen  with  manure-based  vermicompost(Abduli et al. 2013; Ayyobi et al. 2014; Akhzari et al. 2015;Yadav et al. 2015)."

Different authors have provided different explana-tions  for  the  pesticidal  properties  of  the  vermicompostwhich  basically  revolve  around  two  conjectures:  betternutrient availability hence greater vitality in warding offinfection, and presence of pathogen-destroying microor-ganisms  (Arancon  et  al.  2005;  2008;  Yardim  et  al.  2006;Cardoza  2011;  Singh  et  al.  2013;  Xiao  et  al.  2016).  Thepresent  studies  indicate  that  the  vermicompost  of  par-thenium  is  also  imbibed  with  a  similar  attribute.  Paststudies  on  manure-based  vermicompost  have  indicatedthat  better  nutrient  availability  and  presence  of  antimi-crobial  compounds  such  as  flavonoids,  phenolics,  andhumic acids in the vermicompost may have induced theresistance to pathogens in the plants (Graham and Webb1991;  Hill  et  al.  1999;  Haviola  et  al.  2007;  Sahni  et  al."
s31,333,628,6,4254,4345,56,213,236,WarnockPro-Regular,9,2008;  Edwards  et  al.  2010).  Similarly  beneficial  attrib-utes  seem  to  be  present  in  parthenium’s  vermicompostas well.

s32,5,12,1,50,299,63,61,462,MyriadPro-Light,10,This study was conducted to develop fast and cost effective methods for the determination of caf‑feine in green coffee beans. In the present work direct determination of caffeine in aqueous solution of green coffeebean was performed using FT‑IR‑ATR and fluorescence spectrophotometry. Caffeine was also directly determined indimethylformamide solution using NIR spectroscopy with univariate calibration technique.

NIR spec‑trophotometry can also be used as alternative choice of caffeine determination using reduced amount of organicsolvent (dimethylformamide) and univariate calibration technique. These analytical methods may therefore, be rec‑ommended for the rapid, simple, safe and cost effective determination of caffeine in green coffee beans."

Hence, it is impor-tant  to  develop  simple  analytical  methods  in  order  tocharacterize and identify the amount of caffeine in coffeebeans."
s32,26,59,2,890,1342,56,225,236,WarnockPro-Regular,9,"Many  analytical  methods  have  been  developed  forthe  determination  of  caffeine  in  coffee  beans  and  prod-ucts  containing  caffeine  including  electroanalytical  [7,8];  chromatographic  [4,  9,  10]  techniques  includinggas  chromatography  [11–13],  high  performance  liquidchromatography  (HPLC)  [4,  10,  14,  15],  liquid  chroma-tography-particle  beam/electron  ionization  mass  spec-trophotometry [16], liquid chromatography-tandem massspectrometry [17], and spectroscopic techniques [1, 4, 18–22]  including  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy[23],  near  infrared  spectroscopy  [24,  25],  near  infra-redreflectance  spectroscopy  [26],  and  UV–Vis  spectroscopy[1,  20,  27,  28],  and  fluorescence  polarization  immunoas-says [29].

But UV–Vis spectrophoto-metric method cannot be used directly for determinationof caffeine in coffee beans extracted with water owing tothe matrix effect of UV–Vis absorbing substances in thesample matrix [9]. In aqueous solution of coffee beans itwas observed that there is spectral interference from caf-feine  and  chlorogenic  acid  in  the  wavelength  regions  of200–500  nm.  Yet  this  method  requires  the  extraction  ofcaffeine from the aqueous solution of coffee beans usingdichloromethane  for  the  spectroscopic  determination.This  is  necessary  since  the  caffeine  spectrum  is  over-lapped with other compounds found in coffee.

Waterwas  used  for  the  whole  process  which  is  the  cheapestsolvent  found  everywhere,  environmentally  friendlyand  can  help  to  perform  experiments  without  suffer-ing  from  the  toxic  nature  of  different  organic  solvents.NIR  spectrophotometry  can  also  be  used  as  alterna-tive  choice  of  method  for  caffeine  determination  usingreduced  amount  of  organic  solvent  (dimethylforma-mide)  and  univariate  calibration  technique.  Therefore,a  quantitative  determination  of  caffeine  in  green  coffeebeans  become  feasible  by  employing  the  present  pro-posed  spectroscopic  methods  with  simple,  short  timeof  analysis  and  inexpensive  procedure.  In  addition  themethods  have  been  tested  for  roasted  coffee  beans  andare applicable with the same procedure. These analyticalmethods may therefore, be recommended for the rapid,simple, safe and cost effective determination of caffeinein coffee beans."

Due to the increasing priceof crude oil and the demand for light oleﬁns, as well as thelarger demand for propylene than ethylene, a growingnumber of researchers were dedicating to developing thenon-oil route for producing low carbon oleﬁns, in especial,propylene [1–8].

In previous studies, two mechanisms were presented,dual cycle mechanism and alkene cycle mechanism.According to the dual cycle mechanism, ethylene andpropylene are mainly produced through the cracking ofaromatic intermediates, which are generated in the pres-ence of strong acid sites. And propene is additionallyproduced from the cracking of higher oleﬁn in the alkenecycles [27]. Low number of strong acid sites reduced theamount of active aromatic intermediates, and then loweredthe yield of ethylene, but the relatively rapid progress ofthe alkene cycle might cause a high yield of propene. Thedeclination of ethylene and the increase of propylene in thisexperiment could be explained by the reduction of strongacid sites, which was necessary for the formation of aro-matic intermediates. It was also reported that [10, 28], the"

These changes in acidity due to the interaction ofMg with zeolite strong acid sites might generate new acidsites [19]. The impregnation of Mg neutralized surface acidsites and also induced pore plugging, which signiﬁcantlyreduced the quantity and the strength of acid sites [24]."

These resultscould be explained by the interaction of promoter specieswith parent zeolite framework, which resulted in maskingthe acid sites and forming new acid sites [25, 26].

s34,6,25,1,50,332,51,159,238,YfsykdAdvPTimes,9,"Alumina-supported NiMoPOx catalysts havebeen prepared using urea matrix combustion–decompositionmethod. The effect of urea/metal ratios on the metal oxidedispersion, the conversion of the metal precursor to oxideand the structure and catalyst performance for diesel HDShas been studied. It is shown that the addition of urea adjuststhe metal–support interaction, leading to the easy reductionof the metal oxide over the catalyst surface. It also changesthe surface cluster of the oxide and the oxide structure. Theaddition of urea to metal matrix signiﬁcantly improves thecatalytic diesel HDS performance and increases the catalyststability. The urea to Ni metal ratio of 2 gives the highestsulfur removal rate in the real diesel HDS process."

s35,8,16,1,50,332,51,171,238,AdvPTimes,9,"Public policy, dollar rate, market prices, con-tracts values and equipment efﬁciency inﬂuence the costsof the energy sources at an ethylene plant. The aim of thisresearch is to identify energy efﬁciency opportunities at theenergy management resources in a petrochemical industry.It was proved that using MILP makes it possible to achieveenergy efﬁciency gains. MILP proved to be effective,accurate and robust. It conﬁrmed the importance of mod-eling and simulation with quick response and its imple-mentation in a higher possible rate, since the potentialgains running the model once per day were 81% higherthan performing it once a month. The optimal resourceschoice had an average annual potential saving of US$556.000/year."

This  includes  encouraging  FAIR  [1]outputs  and  clear,  open  licensing,  resulting  in  researchproducts  that  can  be  reused  and  reproduced.  Recentupdates  to  the  journal’s  website  exemplify  our  attemptsto encourage reuse of data from articles (e.g. integrationwith FigShare)."

This  leads  to  an  obviousquestion:  what  do  we  consider  cheminformatics?  Ananswer  to  this  allows  us  to  judge  where  innovation  lies.Very broadly, cheminformatics addresses the generation,representation  and  manipulation  of  chemical  informa-tion,  with  the  chemical  structure  at  its  foundation.  Andthus  innovation  can  occur  at  multiple  levels,  startingfrom  the  chemical  structure  itself  (non-graph  represen-tations,  learned  representations)  to  novel  ways  to  inte-grate  chemical  information  with  other  data  types  (such"

We have devel-oped and validated an accurate and robust method for the analysis of IOT in human plasma and urine. The mobilephase consisted of methanol and 50 mM sodium phosphate (10:90; v/v).

Precision and accuracy werewithin 15% for IOT in both plasma and urine. The recoveries of IOT in urine and plasma ranged between 93.14% and114.74 and 96.04–118.38%, respectively. The linear range for urine and plasma assays were 25–1500 and 1–150 µg/mL respectively. The lower limits of detection were 0.5 µg/mL for both urine and plasma, with no interference fromplasma and urine matices. This method has been fully validated according to FDA guidelines and the new HPLC assayhas been applied to a new formulation of IOT (Conray"

s40,9,29,1,50,471,56,204,236,NbhhnjWarnockPro-Regular,9,"Renal  function  is  best  studied  with  accurate  measure-ment  of  glomerular  filtration  rate  (GFR)  in  pre-clinicalstudies,  clinical  practice  and  clinical  trials  [1–3].  Inulin[4, 5] and creatinine [6, 7] clearances are accepted refer-ence  standards  for  determining  GFR  but  are  expensiveand  laborious.  Colorimetric  assays  are  used  to  detectInulin, which is very expensive and also in very short sup-ply and many problems with the assay [8]. 24-h creatinineclearance overestimates GFR in patients with poor renalfunction  and  a  variety  of  other  glomerular  diseases  anddrugs  can  make  creatinine  clearance  and  serum  creati-nine a poor markers of GFR estimation [9, 10]. GFR esti-mated from serum creatinine using prediction equationsmay  result  in  unpredictable  error  when  the  diagnosisof  chronic  kidney  disease  is  unknown  [1–3,  6,  7,  11–23].

It  seems  to  be  affected  byfactors other than renal function alone [27–33]. Usually,iothalamate (IOT) clearance [2, 3, 15, 20, 22, 34, 35] areused  to  measure  GFR.  Mostly,  radioactive  compoundsare also used to perform IOT clearances [36–38], whichhave  radioactive  health  and  safety  issues.  That’s  why  wehave used non-radioactive IOT for analysis."

Initial methods for sample prepara-tion consisted of several time-consuming extraction andevaporation  steps.  Also,  the  sensitivity  of  some  of  thepreviously  reported  assays  is  not  great,  for  example,  anHPLC–UV method published by Farthing et al. had a lin-ear range for the detection of IOT in plasma from 10 to50 µg/mL [40]. Later developed procedures reduced sam-ple preparation to a single precipitation step or an ultra-filtration step prior to analysis. LC–MS methods are also"

s41,26,64,1,50,357,306,146,238,HvnljtAdvPTimes,9,"Excessive exploitation and environmental destruction havebeen fatalities for the utilization of coal, petroleum and gascurrently. To deal with the depletion of fossil energy andenvironmental issues caused by the released carbon dioxide,biofuel was considered as one of the proposed solutions tosubstitute the usage of fossil fuel [1]. Generally, the biofuelgenerated from lignocellulose conversion had attracted moreattentions [2]. The sawdust is an abundant residual forestbiomass, which has not been utilized and is usually burneddirectly, leading to energy waste and environmental pollu-tion. Thus, it is necessary to convert the residual to obtainbio-oil or useful chemicals through process techniques."
s41,27,65,1,50,506,306,196,238,HvnljtAdvPTimes,9,"Thermochemical conversion processes including lique-faction, pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation were employed to con-vert lignocellulose into liquid fuel [3–5]. Among thesemethods, liquefaction is a preferred technology due to itsmild operation temperature, which could avoid cross linkedand reverse reaction during liquefaction process. It is wellknown that the quality of bio-oil highly depended on the"
s41,27,66,1,50,506,306,196,238,HvnljtAdvPTimes,9,"used solvent. The obtained bio-oil derived from biomassliquefaction with water as reaction medium has a lowercarbon content and higher oxygen content, thus its heatingvalue is much lower [6]. To enhance the heating value ofliquid fuel, organic solvents were utilized in the lignocel-lulose conversion instead of water. Especially, the criticaltemperature and pressure of organic solvents are far belowthan that of water; therefore, the reaction could be carriedout at milder conditions."
s41,28,67,1,50,706,306,59,238,HvnljtAdvPTimes,9,"Among these organic solvents, from the viewpoint ofenvironmental friendliness, ethanol could be the mostpromising solvent in the biomass conversion. On the otherhand, it also has some advantages [7]. First, the criticalpoints of ethanol are far below than that of water, so the"

Second,as a hydrogen donor, ethanol can provide the activehydrogen to stabilize the produced intermediates. Third,the acidic components included in the bio-oil fractions canreact with ethanol via esteriﬁcation reaction to obtain ethylesters compounds that are similar to biodiesel."
s41,33,72,2,890,1024,51,259,238,HvnljtAdvPTimes,9,"Recently, extensive researches have been received onthe liquefaction of lignocellulose in the ethanol. Huanget al.

During the liquefaction process, theintermediates produced may be stabilized immediately bythe hydrogen free radicals to form the liquid products. Thehigher the hydrogen initial pressure, the more the hydrogenfree radicals produced. The free radicals from the decom-position of sawdust could be stabilized well under thehigher hydrogen pressure, which prevented the condensa-tion, cyclization and re-polymerization reactions [21]. Onthe other hand, the higher the system pressure obtained, thelesser the liquid components would be gasiﬁed."

Different  from  pre-vious  relation  extraction  tasks  such  as  protein–proteininteraction,  disease-gene  association,  and  miRNA-geneinteraction [23, 25, 28–32, 44], the BC5 task requires theoutput of extracted relations with entities normalized to acontrolled vocabulary (the National Library of Medicine’sMedical Subject Headings (MeSH) identifiers were used).Furthermore, one should extract such a list of <ChemicalID, Disease ID> pairs from the entire PubMed documentand  many  relations  may  be  described  across  sentences[53].  For  instance,  Fig.  1  shows  the  title  and  abstract  ofa  document  (PMID  2375138)  with  two  CID  relations<D008874,  D006323>  and  <D008874,  D012140>.  Whilethe  former  relation  (“midazolam”  and  “cardiorespiratoryarrest”) is in the same sentence, the latter relation (“mida-zolam”  and  “respiratory  and  cardiovascular  depression”)is not. Moreover, not all pairs of chemicals and diseasesare  involved  in  a  CID  relation.  For  instance,  there  is  norelation  between  “midazolam”  and  “death”  in  Fig.  1because  the  task  guidelines  consider  “death”  to  be  toogeneral."
s42,17,40,2,890,1246,56,225,236,StmntcLrgyfjWarnockPro-Regular,9,"During  the  BioCreative  V  challenge,  a  new  gold-standard  data  set  was  created  for  system  developmentand evaluation, including manual annotations of chemi-cals,  diseases  and  their  CID  relations  in  1500  PubMedarticles [30]. A large number of international teams par-ticipated  and  achieved  the  best  performance  of  57.07in  F-score  for  the  CID  relation  extraction  task.  In  thiswork, we aim to improve the best results obtained in thechallenge  by  combining  a  rich-feature  machine  learn-ing  approach  with  additional  training  data  obtainedwithout additional annotation cost from existing entriesin  curated  databases.  We  demonstrate  the  feasibil-ity  of  converting  the  abundant  manual  annotations  inbiomedical  databases  into  labeled  instances  that  canbe  readily  used  by  supervised  machine-learning  algo-rithms. Our work therefore joins a few other studies indemonstrating  the  use  of  the  curated  knowledge  freelyavailable in biomedical databases for assisting text-min-ing tasks [17, 46, 48]."
s42,18,41,2,890,982,304,309,236,StmntcLrgyfjWarnockPro-Regular,9,"More specifically, we formulate the relation extractiontask  as  a  classification  task  on  chemical-disease  pairs.Our  classification  model  is  based  on  Support  VectorMachine  (SVM).  It  uses  a  set  of  rich  features  that  com-bine the advantages of rule-based and statistical methods.While relation extraction tasks were first tackled usingsimple  methods  such  as  co-occurrence,  lately  moreadvanced  machine  learning  systems  have  been  investi-gated due to the increasing availability of annotated cor-pora [52]. Typically, the relation extraction task has beenconsidered  as  a  classification  problem.  For  each  pair,useful  information  from  NLP  tools  including  part-of-speech taggers, full parsers, and dependency parsers wereextracted as features [20, 56]. In the BioCreative V, severalmachine learning models have been explored for the CIDtask,  including  Naïve  Bayes  [30],  maximum  entropy  [14,19],  logistic  regression  [21],  and  support  vector  machine(SVM).  In  general,  the  use  of  SVM  has  achieved  betterperformance [53]. One of the highest-performing systemswas proposed by Xu et al. [55] with two independent SVMmodels,  sentence-level  and  document-level  classifiers  forthe CID task. We instead combined the feature vector onboth  the  sentence  and  document  level  and  developed  aunified model. We believe our system is more robust andcan be used more easily for other relation extraction taskswith less effort needed for domain adaptation."
s42,19,42,2,890,1293,304,93,236,StmntcLrgyfjWarnockPro-Regular,9,"SVM-based systems using rich features have been pre-viously  studied  in  biomedical  relation  extraction  [5,  50,51].  Most  useful  feature  sets  include  lexical  informationand  various  linguistic/semantic  parser  outputs  [1,  2,  15,23,  38].  Built  upon  these  studies,  our  rich  feature  setsinclude both lexical/syntactic features as previously sug-gested as well as task specific ones like the CID patternsand domain knowledge as mentioned below."
s42,20,43,2,890,1390,304,81,236,StmntcLrgyfjWarnockPro-Regular,9,"Although  machine  learning-based  approaches  haveachieved the highest results, some rule-based and hybridsystems  [22,  33]  showed  highly  competitive  results  dur-ing  the  BioCreative  Challenge.  In  our  system,  we  alsointegrate the output of a pattern matching subsystem inour  feature  vector. Thus,  our  approach  can  benefit  fromboth machine-learning and rule-based approaches."

s42,40,80,3,1731,1882,56,357,236,StmntcLrgyfjWarnockPro-Regular,9,"Another  major  novelty  of  this  work  lies  in  our  crea-tion  of  additional  training  data  from  existing  docu-ment-level  annotations  in  a  curated  knowledge  baseto  improve  the  system  performance  and  to  reducethe  effort  of  manual  text  corpus  annotation.  Specifi-cally,  we  make  use  of  previously  curated  data  in  CTDas  additional  training  data.  Unlike  the  fully  annotatedBC5  corpus,  these  additional  training  data  are  weaklylabeled:  CID  relations  are  linked  to  the  source  articlesin  PubMed  (i.e.  document-level  annotations)  but  theactual appearances of the disease and chemicals in therelation are not labeled in the article (i.e. mention-levelannotations  are  absent).  Hence  they  are  not  directlyapplicable  and  have  to  be  repurposed  when  used  fortraining  our  machine-learning  algorithm.  Supervisedmachine-learning  approaches  require  annotated  train-ing data which may be difficult to obtain in large scale.To  acquire  training  data,  people  have  recently  studiedvarious  methods  using  unlabeled  or  weakly  labeleddata [6, 37, 48, 57, 58]. However, such data is often toodiverse  and  noisy  to  result  in  high  performance  [43].In  this  paper,  we  created  our  labeled  data  using  theidea  of  distant  supervision  [37]  but  limit  the  data  tobe the weakly labeled article that was the source of thecurated relation. Thus, this work is most closely relatedto Ravikumar et al. [46] with regards to creating train-ing  data  using  existing  database  curation.

It is clear that more curation data, despitethe fact that they are not annotated for training machine-learning  purposes,  helps  improve  the  coverage  and  sys-tem  performance.  We  further  separated  CID  relationsin  the  test  set  into  two  groups  with  respect  to  whethera given relation appeared in the training set (i.e. overlap-ping or not). Figures 7 and 8 show the f-score changes ineach  group  with  additional  data  and  demonstrate  thatboth groups benefited from adding more weakly labeleddata to the training set with more performance gains inthe first “overlapping” group."

For  example,  ourmethod failed to extract the CID relation of “renal injury”(MeSH:  D058186)  and  “diclofenac”  (MeSH:  D004008)from the following sentence: “The renal injury was prob-ably  aggravated  by  the  concomitant  intake  of  a  non-ste-roidal  anti-inflammatory  drug,  diclofenac”.  Our  patternfeature could not be extracted because “aggravate” is notone  of  our  relation  trigger  words.  In  addition,  the  mix-ture  of  chemical-induced  disease  and  chemical-treateddisease  relations  within  one  sentence  often  poses  extrachallenges for feature/pattern extraction. Finally, 15 % oftotal  errors  were  CID  relations  that  are  asserted  acrosssentence  boundaries,  which  motivates  us  to  investigatehow to capture long-distance CID relations in the future."

s45,6,19,1,50,327,63,97,467,JjjnjxMyriadPro-Light,10,"First public disclosure of new chemical entities often takes place in patents, which makes them animportant source of information. However, with an ever increasing number of patent applications, manual process-ing and curation on such a large scale becomes even more challenging. An alternative approach better suited for thislarge corpus of documents is the automated extraction of chemical structures. A number of patent chemistry data-bases generated by using the latter approach are now available but little is known that can help to manage expecta-tions when using them. This study aims to address this by comparing two such freely available sources, SureChEMBLand IBM SIIP (IBM Strategic Intellectual Property Insight Platform), with manually curated commercial databases."
s45,7,20,1,50,429,63,58,462,BwxjgyMyriadPro-Semibold,10,Results:
s45,7,21,1,50,429,63,58,462,JjjnjxMyriadPro-Light,10,"When looking at the percentage of chemical structures successfully extracted from a set of patents, usingSciFinder as our reference, 59 and 51 % were also found in our comparison in SureChEMBL and IBM SIIP, respectively.When performing this comparison with compounds as starting point, i.e. establishing if for a list of compounds thedatabases provide the links between chemical structures and patents they appear in, we obtained similar results.SureChEMBL and IBM SIIP found 62 and 59 %, respectively, of the compound-patent pairs obtained from Reaxys."
s45,8,22,1,50,492,63,108,471,BwxjgyMyriadPro-Semibold,10,Conclusions:
s45,8,23,1,50,492,63,108,471,JjjnjxMyriadPro-Light,10,"In our comparison of automatically generated vs. manually curated patent chemistry databases, theformer successfully provided approximately 60 % of links between chemical structure and patents. It needs to bestressed that only a very limited number of patents and compound-patent pairs were used for our comparison. Nev-ertheless, our results will hopefully help to manage expectations of users of patent chemistry databases of this typeand provide a useful framework for more studies like ours as well as guide future developments of the workflows usedfor the automated extraction of chemical structures from patents. The challenges we have encountered whilst per-forming this study highlight that more needs to be done to make such assessments easier. Above all, more adequate,preferably open access to relevant ‘gold standards’ is required."

One  example  for  such  a  workflow  isthe Strategic IP Insight Platform (SIIP) from IBM [4]. Atthe  end  of  2011,  IBM  announced  [5]  that  in  collabora-tion  with  four  drug  companies  it  would  provide  to  NIH(National Institutes of Health) a database that was gener-ated using the IBM SIIP. The first version of the databasethat was provided contained more than 2.4 million chem-ical  structures  extracted  from  about  4.7  million  patents,as  well  as  11  million  biomedical  journal  abstracts  from1976 to 2000. For this period, images in patents were notprocessed  and  chemical  structures  were  only  derivedfrom  text.  Subsequently,  the  coverage  was  extended  upto the end of 2010 and chemical structures were derivedfrom US Complex Work Units (CWU) [6] and images inWO  patents  for  the  period  2001–2010.

As faras a reference set of patents is concerned, we decided totake  advantage  of  the  work  by  Akhondi  et  al.  [10],  whohave  produced  an  Annotated  Chemical  Patent  Corpus.However,  since  the  annotation  of  the  patent  corpus  was"

We decidedto  produce  the  reference  list  of  chemical  structures  byquerying  the  well-established,  manually-curated  CAS(Chemical  Abstracts  Service)  Registry  [11]  through  Sci-Finder [12]. Since we were only able to retrieve the chem-ical  structures  through  the  SciFinder  web  applicationfor one patent at a time, due to the lack of a suitable API(Application  Programming  Interface)  functionality,  werestricted ourselves to the harmonised subset of 47 pat-ents described by Akhondi et al. [10] and not the entireset of 200 patents. For the 47 patents covering the period1980–2010 SDF files were exported from SciFinder with"
s45,39,78,3,1737,1830,304,153,236,HhfmmyWarnockPro-Regular,9,"the  chemical  structures  of  all  the  molecules  in  the  CASRegistry  associated  with  these  patents,  as  well  as  SDFfiles that only contained the structures of molecules thathad the annotation “Biological Studies” in SciFinder. Therationale for the latter was that the molecules annotatedwith  the  term  “Biological  Studies”  tend  to  be  the  mole-cules that are most relevant and that are the listed exam-ples.  Since  we  hypothesised  that  as  part  of  the  manualextraction  of  chemical  information  from  patents  thesemolecules might possibly get more attention than others,we wanted to be able to look at them separately. For onepatent (US4874794, linked to WO9013287 in SciFinder),no chemical structures could be exported as SDF file."

To perform the compari-son,  the  workflow  tool  Pipeline  Pilot  from  BIOVIA  [13]was used. As input, the workflow used here takes an SDFfile  with  the  chemical  structures  from  SciFinder  and  atext  file  with  the  SMILES  from  SureChEMBL.  For  bothinputs  canonicalised  SMILES  and  InChI  strings  (stand-ard InChI, version 1) [14] were generated for the largestfragment. For example, for metoprolol tartrate canonical-ised SMILES and InChI strings would only be generatedfor metoprolol itself (with 38 non-hydrogen atoms, whilstthe tartaric acid part of metoprolol tartrate only consistsof  10  non-hydrogen  atoms).  The  canonicalised  SMILESand  the  InChI  strings,  respectively,  were  used  to  deter-mine which molecules from SciFinder are also containedin  the  input  file  from  SureChEMBL.  If  not  specificallystated  otherwise,  the  results  below  refer  to  the  InChI-based comparison."

s45,84,132,5,3424,3529,56,621,236,HhfmmyWarnockPro-Regular,9,"Considering  that  in  SureChEMBL  chemical  entitiesare  automatically  extracted  from  patent  documents(regardless  of  whether  they  are  claimed  compounds,reagents,  synthetic  intermediates  etc.),  it  might  notbe  surprising  that  the  number  of  molecules  associ-ated with a patent in SureChEMBL tends to be muchlarger  than  the  corresponding  number  in  SciFinder.For  the  set  of  46  patents  used  for  this  analysis  only12  %  of  compounds  associated  with  the  patents  inSureChEMBL  are  also  associated  with  these  patentsin  SciFinder.  For  compounds  annotated  with  “Bio-logical  Studies”  in  SciFinder  the  overlap  is  only  5  %.This prompts the question of how to identify the rel-evant  compounds  amongst  what  one  could  call  arte-facts  or  noise  (e.g.  reagents,  intermediates,  solvents,radicals,  fragments,  reference  compounds,  and  exist-ing marketed drugs). A SureChEMBL annotation thatcan  help  to  address  this  challenge  is  the  “chemicalcorpus  count”.  It  is  the  count  of  the  number  of  occa-sions  a  chemical  structure  has  been  observed  withinthe whole currently available chemical corpus of Sure-ChEMBL.  Figure  2  shows  how  the  compounds  fromthe subset of 35 patents, for which in SciFinder com-pounds  with  the  annotation  “Biological  Studies”  canbe  found,  are  distributed  across  different  ranges  ofchemical  corpus  count.  As  can  be  seen,  approx.  90  %of  the  compounds  have  a  chemical  corpus  count  ofless than or equal to 30. At the same time, only 16 % ofall molecules found in SureChEMBL for the 35 patentshave a chemical corpus count less than or equal to 30.Hence, applying a filter of chemical corpus count"

InChI strings were used to determine which mole-cules  from  SciFinder  are  also  contained  in  the  input  filefor IBM SIIP. It is worth noting that the total number of(non-unique) molecules for the 46 patents in IBM SIIP is7027 (see Additional file 2), whereas SureChEMBL con-tains  a  total  number  of  12,801  compounds  for  the  samepatents."

For  35  of  the  46  patentsSciFinder  contains  molecules  with  the  annotation  “Bio-logical Studies”. Only 469 (out of 950) of these moleculeswere also found in IBM SIIP.

One of the compounds is example 9 (“(R,S)-2-[1-azadicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinolin-1-one”). IBM SIIP extracted the radical “1-azadi-cyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl”, which suggests that instead of usingthe entire name of the compound for the name to struc-ture  conversion  it  only  used  part  of  it.  We  investigatedwhether it had been caused by the start of a new line inthe patent document, but this was not the case."

These  compounds  were  excluded  from  the  list.The  remaining  543  compounds  were  divided  into  twosubsets.  The  first  one  contains  452  unique  compoundswith at least one EP, US or WO patent (in Reaxys) fromthe  period  1976  to  2010  (i.e.  the  patents  that  fall  withinthe coverage of both SureChEMBL"

They were all complexes with three or more com-ponents.  The  resulting  subset  of  438  compounds  wasused for the comparison between SureChEMBL and IBMSIIP.  Just  to  note,  amongst  the  438  are  99  compoundsthat contain two or three molecular components that arenot covalently bound (e.g. salts). Before the patents wereretrieved for the 438 compounds, the SMILES strings forthose  with  nitro  groups  were  standardized  as  we  foundthat otherwise results are missed when retrieving struc-tures  from  SureChEMBL.  The  second  smaller  subsetcontains  91  compounds  with  EP,  US  or  WO  patents  (inReaxys) that are all for the period 2011 to the present (i.e.patents that are within the coverage of SureChEMBL butnot in IBM SIIP)."
s45,294,535,8,5955,6373,304,129,236,HhfmmyWarnockPro-Regular,9,"The  first  question  we  asked  was  how  many  of  the  438unique compounds are found in SureChEMBL and IBMSIIP,  respectively.  In  an  ideal  setting,  all  compoundsshould  be  found  in  both  sources  since  according  toReaxys at least one patent exists that falls within the cov-erage  of  both  sources. We  determined  whether  or  not  acompound  was  in  IBM  SIIP  by  using  the  UniChem  API[8].  UniChem  contains  IBM  SIIP  compound  IDs,  whichwere  retrieved  using  the  “Get  src_compound_ids  fromInChIKey”  API  call.  For  SureChEMBL,  we  retrieved  allpatents directly from the database."

The latter comprise a notoriously challeng-ing  corpus  for  text  mining,  due  to  obfuscation,  ambigu-ity  and  optical  character  recognition  (OCR)  conversionerrors  during  digitalisation.  Currently,  information  onthe reliability of these automatically generated databasesis not available in the public domain which makes it chal-lenging to judge what these databases can and cannot beused for. A factor contributing to the scarcity of informa-tion related to the reliability of such databases is the factthat it proves to be very challenging to assess this qualityin  a  meaningful  and  reliable  way.  One  key  contributingfactor  is  the  fact  that  such  an  assessment  only  becomespractically feasible if access to a database that can be usedas  ‘gold  standard’  is  available.  Even  then,  access  alone  isnot  sufficient  since  specific  requirements  in  terms  offunctionalities  (e.g.  the  ability  to  perform  searches  withlists and suitable options to export the results) need to besatisfied.

This  finding  prompts  the  ques-tion what the reasons for this substantial discrepancymight be. One likely explanation is that as part of thename-to-structure  conversion  in  the  SureChEMBLand IBM SIIP worflow all recognised chemical namesand synonyms are converted to structure irrespectiveof  their  relevance  whereas  the  annotation  workflowused  for  SciFinder  is  more  selective.  This  leads  to  asituation  where,  for  example,  a  list  of  substituents  inthe  claims  section  is  converted  to  separate  chemicalentities like the methyl radical. The latter is amongstthe  chemical  structures  from  SureChEMBL  for  37  ofthe 46 patents. In agreement with the above, only 6 %"

Also, approx. 80 % of the chemical structuresin SureChEMBL or IBM SIPP that occur in more than5 of the 46 patents have a heavy-atom count of 10 orless.  Hence,  it  appears  that  a  large  percentage  of  thecompounds  from  SureChEMBL  and  IBM  SIPP  mightnot be particularly relevant. These observations high-light  that  for  automatically  generated  patent  chemis-try databases strategies need to be devised that allowfor  the  most  relevant  compounds  to  be  easily  identi-fied  amongst  all  the  compounds  associated  with  agiven  patent  in  these  databases.

The  challenges  we  have  encounteredwhilst  attempting  to  perform  benchmarking  of  patentchemistry  databases  that  automatically  extract  chemicalstructures from patents highlights that more needs to bedone to make this task easier. An already ongoing effortis  to  make  SureChEMBL  data  accessible  via  the  OpenPHACTS API [21, 22]. More importantly, more adequate,preferably  open  access  to  relevant  ‘gold  standards’  isrequired. If the latter is not provided it will be difficult todecide where to focus development efforts in the future."

s46,11,25,1,50,332,51,234,238,HnmhlhAdvPTimes,9,"Methane steam reforming experiments werecarried out at atmospheric pressure fortemperaturesbetween 873 and 1073 K and by varying the partial pressureof methane and steam to achieve S:C between 0.5 and 2.5.Mechanistic considerations for Methane steam reforming(MSR) were derived on the basis of Langmuir–Hinshelwoodand Eley–Rideal reaction mechanisms based on single- anddual-site associative and dissociative adsorption of one orboth reactants. However, discrimination of these models onstatistical and thermodynamic grounds revealed that themodel representing a single-site dissociative adsorption ofmethane and steam most adequately explained the data.However, the product formation rates from these experi-ments were reasonably captured by power-law model. Theparameter estimates from the power-law model revealed anorder of 0.94 with respect to methane and"

To further increase butanol/acetone ratio, tiny amount of electron carrier, neutral red was supplemented intocassava-based substrate at 60 h when butonal production rate reached maximal level.

The butyrate loop not only competeswith butanol synthesis route for carbon resource, butalso relates to acetone formation. Therefore, high buta-nol/acetone ratio in cassava-based fermentation wasalso attributed to weakened metabolic strength of butyrateclosed-loop. It could be concluded that higher NADHgeneration rate and lower metabolic flux in butyrateclosed-loop worked jointly, leading to the high butanol/acetone ratio feature in fermentation with cassava-basedsubstrate."

Among these approaches, adding neutral redseems to be the most appropriate one of low-cost and easyto operate. In the previous works, it has been demon-strated that adding neutral red could acquire a 63% incre-ment in butanol/acetone ratio with corn-based substrate[26,18]. Therefore, neutral red was added into cassavabroth at 60 h when butanol production rate was in arelatively high level, in order to further enhance buta-nol/acetone ratio.

The simultaneous enhancement ofboth butanol and acetone synthesis route led to an un-changed butanol/acetone ratio in cassava-based fermen-tation with neutral red addition. It was speculated thatunder the reductive compound-enriched environmentusing cassava-based substrate, reductive power NADHmight have been excessively produced/consumed leadingto a burden on cellular metabolism [33].

s50,8,30,1,50,423,56,144,236,WarnockPro-Regular,9,"Indiscriminate  use  of  chemicals  has  led  to  severe  con-tamination  of  environmental  segments  by  heavy  metals.Heavy metals are non-biodegradable and tend to be bio-magnified in the food chain (Singh et al. 2008). They posea  risk  to  human  health  when  transferred  via  food  chainand  can  further  lead  to  toxic  effects  in  organisms  evenin trace amounts. These metals can hinder different cel-lular processes. Their effects are generally concentrationdependent and also differ with respect to individual tox-icity. Hence, it becomes crucial to remove them prior tofinal discharge of effluents in environmental segments."

Bioremediation  is  a  way  of  cleaning  up  heavymetals  using  biomass  (or  microorganisms)  through  theprocesses  of  biodegradation,  biosorption,  bioaccumu-lation  and  bioconversion  operating  in  different  ways(Kulshreshtha  et  al.  2014;  Mosa  et  al.  2016). The  micro-organisms  bind  to  heavy  metals  and  concentrate  them(Joutey et al. 2015). Biosorption is a passive process andheavy metals get adsorbed on the surface of the biosorb-ent (Velásquez and Dussan 2009) exhibiting the toleranceof biosorbent towards heavy metals. The mechanisms likeextracellular  (chelation  and  cell  wall  binding)  and  intra-cellular (binding to compounds like proteins) sequestra-tion of heavy metals have been proposed as mechanismsfor  heavy  metals  tolerance  in  fungi  (Fawzy  et  al.  2017).Biosorbent  from  mushrooms  can  be  prepared  frommycelium  or  fruit  body  (live  or  dead)  and  spent  mush-room  substrate  (SMS).

The potential of fungal biomassas biosorbent has been accepted for the removal of heavymetals  and  radionuclides  from  polluted  waters  becauseof their excellent metal binding properties and tolerancetowards  metals  and  adverse  environment  like  diversepH and temperature conditions (Qazilbash 2004; Anandet al. 2006; Yazdani et al. 2010; Salman et al. 2014).
