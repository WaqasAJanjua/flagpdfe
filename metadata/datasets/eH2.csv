e37,1067,"Bryan Boyer, Justin Cook, and Marco Steinberg describe stewardship as “the art ofgetting things done amidst a complex and dynamic context. Stewardship is a coreability for agents of change when many minds are involved in conceiving a courseof action, and many hands in accomplishing it.”"
e37,1457,"Miyamoto Musashi, is one of the greatest attempts to describe the embodied cog-nition of kendo . Thomas Cleary’s translation includes another classic descriptionof embodied cognition, the house book of Munenori Yagy , sword teacher to theshoguns. Drawing on these accounts and others, I have considered these issues inrelation to design education and design theory."
e37,1522,"Lindgaard, Wesselius, and the commentators attempt to anchor these issues inthe larger conversation of embodied cognition and neuroscience. Their article ledto a series of conversations and debates among reviewers and editors. Recognizingboth virtues and gaps, we decided to publish it to open a serious conversation."

e37,1910,"Leah Ceccarelli describes the importance of What is Life? in terms of the con-versations to which it gave rise. New fields and new ideas emerge through fourongoing conversations: the rhetoric of science, rhetorical inquiry, the history ofscience, and interdisciplinarity. As Ceccarelli points out with respect to mistakesin What is Life? , a vital author may be wrong and yet fruitful in advancing a newfield by helping people to focus on key issues."
e37,2262,One confusion in design is a tendency to use the terms “knowledge creation”
e37,2275,"and “research” as though they mean the same thing. They are not the same, andnot all knowledge creation is research. Most legitimate ways to create knowledgedo not constitute research. Learning creates knowledge. Learning how to do some-thing creates knowledge for the learner. Every day, billions of people learn skillsand facts that are new to them. In schools and homes, at work and leisure, thesebillions gather information and develop capacities that extend their knowledge.While each of these individuals is engaged in knowledge creation, we do not be-lieve that each of these people engages in research."
e37,3563,Here we come to a crucial aspect in Murphy’s article: the role of explanation in
e37,3576,research.
e37,3589,"Research requires explanation. It requires explanatory power and demands anarrative account if it is to produce knowledge for all members of a research field,a discipline, or a profession. This is why we describe research as “a contributionto the knowledge of the field.” In this article, Murphy gives particular attention todoctoral research. He distinguishes between description and explanation—linkingextended explanation to the demonstration of serious research in a Ph.D. thesis.One criterion of the Ph.D. as a research doctorate involves making “an originalcontribution to the knowledge of the field”—sometimes described in shorter formas “an original contribution to knowledge.” The ability to engage in independentresearch is the fundamental criterion for awarding a research doctorate. The Ph.D.thesis is a demonstration that the apprentice researcher is able to do research—the“journeyman piece” that warrants admission to the guild of practicing researchprofessionals."
