m25,2375,"Figure 3. Molecular structures of Azobenzene, 5CB and MBBA. 3. Results 3.1. Observation of Photo-Response After taking the double emulsions, they were observed by the microscope. Their defect patterns were randomly oriented. For observation of the photo-response of the LC double emulsions, we selected the ones which showed their defect pattern facing the top side, because the defect pattern change by a UV irradiation was easy to observe. Before studying the photo-response, the LC alignment in the double emulsion was considered. The defect pattern of the LC emulsion made of 5CB is shown in Figure 4a. Since our experimental condition was similar as the one in a previous study [11], the alignment of LC molecules is considered based on it as well as the basics described in a review [20], and the schematic drawing of the LC alignment is given in Figure 4a. Due to the planer boundary condition, the LC molecules align parallel to the sphere interface except the defect position. At the defect position, the molecules are aligned vertically to the center of the defect. In general, a crossed pattern is observed at a defect position. In Figure 4a, two crossed patters were overlapped because two defects on the outer and inner surfaces were observed at the same time due to the thin shell. This can be confirmed by the fact that one of the crossed pattern reached the outer interface, while the other crossed pattern reached the boundary of the inner shell. We frequently observed this type of double emulsions, and it indicates that the two defects preferred to stay close, probably due to the minimization of the elastic potential."

The square cavity withporosity ( ε ) has a height (H) as shown in Figure 1. The top wall is moving from left to right at a constantspeed U and is maintained at a constant temperature θ , whereas the bottom wall is maintainedat a constant temperature θ ( θ < θ ). All other remaining walls are adiabatic and insulated.A uniform magnetic ﬁeld of strength (B ) is applied in the direction normal to the cavity cross section.
